/**
 * The nightly browser run: boot a throwaway server, render the board and a doc
 * in headless Chrome through `ui:shot`, and judge what came back.
 *
 *   bun run ui:nightly [--port 8899] [--out-dir .ui-nightly] [--keep]
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A WORKFLOW STEP THAT CALLS `ui:shot` DIRECTLY.
 * `ui:shot` renders and reports; it has no notion of a wrong answer, so a
 * workflow that only calls it is green on a page that laid out entirely wrong.
 * The verdicts live in `ui-nightly-lib.ts`, where they are unit tested against
 * recorded payloads — this file is the plumbing that gets a real page in front
 * of them.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NIGHTLY AND NOT A PR GATE (Bryan, 2026-09-05). It wants a Chrome
 * binary, TWO server processes and six full page renders. That is the expensive
 * kind of job, and the regressions it catches are the kind that can wait a day.
 * The stylesheet-reading tests in packages/workspaces-app/test stay on every
 * PR; this does not replace them, it stands behind them with a layout engine.
 *
 * THE SERVER POSTURES IT MEASURES — BOTH OF THEM, one server each.
 * `CW_REQUIRE_SIGNIN_TO_WRITE=0` is what a signed-in person sees; `=1` with a
 * browser that has proven nobody is what a reader following a shared link
 * gets, and it inserts `.signin-bar` as a fourth in-flow child of `#shell` and
 * re-declares the shell's track list (`body.signin-gated #shell` in
 * styles.css). This file used to run only the first and say in this paragraph
 * that the second "deserves its own checks" — which was true, and was standing
 * in for a check that did not exist. The signed-out doc then shipped the exact
 * dead band `shell-main-reaches-bottom` is named after while this job was
 * green every night on a page it never rendered.
 *
 * `--port` names the FIRST port; each further posture takes the next one up.
 *
 * Everything it creates — a data dir, a seeded workspace and a sample file per
 * posture, and the server processes — is thrown away on exit, including on a
 * signal, and each posture's server is stopped as soon as its shots are taken.
 * `--keep` leaves the data dirs behind when something needs looking at by hand.
