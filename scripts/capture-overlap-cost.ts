/**
 * What the tick-boundary overlap costs per capture pass.
 *
 * The task-capture prompt now also carries the tail of the previous tick,
 * marked as already read (`overlapWindow` in meeting-task-capture.ts). That
 * is speech the model reads a second time, on every tick, for the whole
 * meeting — so the size of it is a number worth having rather than
 * estimating. This prints it, measured by the token counter the capture call
 * itself is billed by, not by dividing characters by four.
 *
 *   bun run scripts/capture-overlap-cost.ts
 *
 * It needs the same dedicated key the capture pass uses (Keychain or
 * `--api-key`), and it is FREE: /v1/messages/count_tokens counts, it does not
 * generate. With no key it still prints the character delta and says that the
 * token figures are estimates.
 *
 * The transcript below is invented. The repo is public.
