 * Mechanical audit of the testing standards in .claude/rules/testing-standards.md.
 *
 * Three counts, each a proxy for one standard. A proxy is not the standard:
 * the script cannot tell a test that asserts behaviour from one that asserts
 * source text, so every check below states the pattern it actually matches and
 * the rule file states the standard the pattern stands in for.
 *
 * The counts ratchet. scripts/test-audit.baseline.json holds the highest count
 * each check is allowed to reach; exceeding it fails. Lower a baseline in the
 * same commit that lowers the count, never on its own.
 *
 * Files are enumerated tracked AND untracked-but-not-ignored, so a test file
 * you have written but not staged is judged here exactly as CI will judge it
 * once it is committed. See `gitFiles` for what went wrong when it was not.
 *
 *   bun run test:audit            print the table, exit non-zero over baseline
 *   bun run test:audit --list     also print every matching site

// 2. Source-shape tests: a test that reads a source, bundle or stylesheet file

//    for the read, so nine MCP tests that read `packages/mcp/src` through
//    `test/harness/mcp-source.ts` were invisible — and two of them had
//    silently widened their slice to the whole file tail while the table
//    stayed green. And it used to require `toContain`/`toMatch`, so
//    `shell-grid-placement.test.ts` and `list-indent-css.test.ts`, which
//    parse a stylesheet and assert the parsed value with `toBe` and
//    `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual`, had never been counted at all.
//
//    So a test now counts when it reads source directly OR imports a module
//    that does. Moving the read one file away is not an escape.
//
//    What it still cannot see, so that nobody reads a clean table as proof:
//
//    - A read whose path is in a constant declared elsewhere.
//      `review-item-tools.test.ts` reads a `BUNDLE` const built twenty lines
//      up, and no window over the call site can see it. A WRAPPED call is no
//      longer in this list: `readCallArgs` follows the call across the lines
//      the formatter put it on, so the literal only has to be inside the
//      call's own parentheses, not on the same line as its name.
//    - A support module outside a `test/` directory. The walk stops at the
//      edge of the test tree on purpose, and a reader parked in `src/` or in
//      a sibling `helpers/` is therefore invisible.

 *  - every exported value annotated. No annotation is no evidence.

 * nothing to say about the other way this check reports a site it should not:
 * a read whose PATH is not repo source at all. Two shapes of that are already
 * in the tree and neither is a source grep —
 *
 *  - `readFileSync(join(rel.markdownAppDir, 'app.js'))` in
 *    `client-release.test.ts`, where the directory is a tmpdir the test
 *    published into a moment earlier. The bare filename `'app.js'` is what
 *    matches, and restricting `.js` to literals containing a slash would hide
 *    the real stylesheet sites, which are bare filenames too (`'board.css'`).
 *  - `JSON.parse(readFileSync('packages/plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json'))`
 *    in `launcher.test.ts`, which compares two artifacts' PARSED fields and
 *    asserts on no text at all.
 *
 * A third shape, added when the MCP sweep reached it: a read whose path IS
 * repo source, but whose text is the INPUT to the transform under test rather
 * than its subject. `css-minify.test.ts` feeds the widget stylesheet's raw
 * literal to `minifyCss` and asserts only RELATIONS between the input and the
 * output — every interpolation preserved, every rule block still there, the
 * result smaller. A renamed selector changes both sides and can neither pass
 * nor fail a case. It is the `fixtures/` carve-out ("a parser driven over
 * sample input is behaviour") applied where the sample has to be the real
 * file, because a copy would drift away from what the build actually feeds.
 * The discriminator a reviewer can check: is there any assertion whose
 * expected value is a literal from the file? If yes, it is a source grep and
 * this marker does not apply.
 *
 * WHAT KEEPS IT FROM BECOMING A HIDING PLACE. Three things, and the first two
 * are the same discipline `// timed:` runs on:
 *
 *  - The marker is a claim a reviewer reads, sitting on the line or in the
 *    comment block directly above it, so a diff that adds one is a diff that
 *    argues for it.
 *  - A REASON is required. `// audit: not-source` alone exempts nothing —
 *    the regex needs a dash and a non-empty word after it, so the marker
 *    cannot be pasted in as a bare silencer.
 *  - It reaches the DIRECT read form only, never the harness-import form.
 *    A test that reaches source through a reading module still counts, and
 *    still has to make its case at the module, where the exemption can be
 *    checked against what the module exports rather than believed.

 *
 * The count above has a 500ms floor and a `// timed:` exemption, and both are
 * right for what it is: a gate against a NEW long sleep. Neither can see the
 * shape the suite actually accumulated. `sse-replay.test.ts` held twenty-eight
 * waits of 150-400ms — 9.7 seconds, every one of them under the floor — and
 * `sse-keepalive.test.ts` held a legitimate `// timed:` 15s that was the single
 * most expensive file in the suite. `fixedSleeps` read zero through all of it.
 *
 * So this is the other half: every fixed wait the suite declares, whatever its
 * size, `// timed:` ones included, added up. A wait that is exempt from the
 * count is not exempt from the clock, and this is the number a builder's
 * two-minute verdict is actually made of.
 *
 * It is STATIC — a sum over source text, not a measurement — so it reads the
 * same on a loaded box as on an idle one and nothing here is a wall-clock
 * assertion. It is a CEILING that ratchets down, in the style of
 * `packages/server/test/board-payload.baseline.json`.
 *
 * What it cannot see, so nobody reads it as the suite's idle time: a wait
 * inside a poll loop's own interval, a server-side debounce a test waits out
 * through `waitFor`, a value arriving from a helper in another file, and every
 * process start. The measured wall clocks live in the baseline's own prose.
