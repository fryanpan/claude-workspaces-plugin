/**
 * Per-package line coverage, measured and ratcheted.
 *
 * Bryan's bar is 80% line coverage per package, or the gap listed per file.
 * This script is the half that makes the number real: it runs both coverage
 * tools, joins their output, prints a table anyone can read in a CI log, and
 * fails when a package falls below the floor recorded in
 * `scripts/coverage.baseline.json`.
 *
 *   bun run coverage           measure, print, exit non-zero below baseline
 *   bun run coverage --list    also list the least-covered files per package
 *   bun run coverage --write   rewrite the baseline to today's numbers
 *   bun run coverage --reuse   parse the last run's lcov instead of re-running
 *
 * ## Two tools, because there are two runners
 *
 * `vitest run` and `bun test packages/server/test` are separate gates and
 * neither can see the other's suite, so neither can measure the other's
 * sources. Each package is therefore assigned to exactly ONE runner (see
 * `PACKAGES`) and read only from that runner's lcov. `@claude-workspaces/core` is
 * additionally exercised by the server suite, so its number here is a floor
 * rather than the whole truth — attributing it twice would mean adding two
 * different instrumenters' line sets together, which is not a percentage of
 * anything.
 *
 * ## The floor is today's number, not 80%
 *
 * A threshold nobody currently meets is a red build, and a red build that is
 * always red gets ignored — so the baseline is the measured number rounded
 * down, and the gate is "do not go backwards". `--list` prints the distance
 * to 80% per file so the gap can be worked down deliberately.
 *
 * ## What a file that no test ever imports counts as
 *
 * Neither tool reports a file it never loaded. Vitest is told `all: true`, so
 * it instruments the whole source tree; bun has no such option, and a handful
 * of server modules are imported by no test at all. Those are counted at zero
 * hits over their CODE lines — non-blank, outside a block comment — which is
 * an approximation of the instrumentable-line count the tools report for
 * everything else. It errs low, which is the safe direction for a floor, and
 * `--list` marks each one `never-imported` so it is never mistaken for a
 * measured 0%.
 *
 * ## The two denominators, and why bun's is not its own
 *
 * Vitest's `all: true` gives a denominator that is a property of the SOURCE:
 * every included file is instrumented whether a test touched it or not, and
 * the line set it reports for a file does not move when the suite is split
 * across `--shard`s. Measured 2026-09-06: four shards merged report exactly
 * the numbers one run reports, to the line.
 *
 * Bun's does move. `bun test --coverage` reports the lines it LEARNED about
 * while running, so the same source file comes back with 298 lines from a run
 * of the whole suite and 660 from the union of that suite run in chunks —
 * `middleware/host-guard.ts`, 1289 lines long, both times with the identical
 * 295 hit. The hits are a fact about the code; that denominator is a fact
 * about the execution. A percentage over it cannot be compared between two
 * runs that were scheduled differently, so a ratcheted floor over it is a
 * gate that fails on how the suite was CHUNKED. It also flatters: 295/298 is
 * 99% of the lines bun happened to notice, and 295 of the file's real code
 * lines is not 99% of anything.
 *
 * So a bun-measured package's denominator is its source's code lines — the
 * same count this file already uses for a never-imported file, applied to
 * every file rather than only the ones no test loaded. That number is
 * identical whether the suite ran in one process or seventy-five, which is
 * what lets `bun run test:server` split across processes without moving the
 * gate. It is a bigger denominator than bun's, so the reported percentage
 * fell when it landed (server: 95.6% → 75.4%) and the floor moved with it in
 * the same commit. Nothing about the tests changed; the ruler did.
