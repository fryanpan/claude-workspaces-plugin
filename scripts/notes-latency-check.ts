/**
 * How long a finished sentence waits before it is in the notes — SPLIT into
 * the two waits that make it up, because they have different fixes.
 *
 *   endpoint lag  = the speaker stops → the engine emits the settled turn.
 *                   Paid inside the vendor's endpoint detector. Measured on
 *                   the real wire by `scripts/endpoint-latency-check.ts`; fed
 *                   in here as `--endpoint-lag`, because this harness has no
 *                   engine in it.
 *   compose lag   = settled turn → the note carrying it reaches the sink.
 *                   Paid by the notes clocks (quiet threshold and cadence
 *                   ceiling) and measured here, on a virtual clock.
 *   total         = the two together, which is the wait a person actually
 *                   feels and the only one worth quoting on its own.
 *
 * Splitting them is the point. The totals moved by tuning an endpoint
 * detector and by moving the notes clocks look identical in a single column,
 * and only one of those is on the table at any given moment — the clocks are
 * held at 4s quiet / 15s cadence deliberately (Bryan, 2026-09-04), so a
 * number that cannot say which half it came from cannot say whether the work
 * that was allowed to happen did anything.
 *
 * THE ENDPOINT LAG IS NOT MERELY ADDED ON. A turn that settles later also
 * starts the quiet timer later, so it can push the whole tick past a cadence
 * boundary. That is why it is modelled inside the script — the settled frame
 * is delivered to `beginNotesSession` at `speech end + endpoint lag` — rather
 * than added to the answer afterwards.
 *
 * It runs the same script under two endpoint lags, so the columns are a
 * before/after of an endpointing change with the notes clocks held still:
 *
 *   bun run scripts/notes-latency-check.ts [--minutes 3] [--json]
 *   bun run scripts/notes-latency-check.ts --endpoint-lag 485 --endpoint-lag-after 211
 *
 * WHY A VIRTUAL CLOCK RATHER THAN A REAL MEETING. A real meeting cannot be
 * replayed identically, so a before/after taken from two of them measures the
 * conversation as much as the code. Here the frame times are the script's, so
 * the two runs differ in one thing only.
 *
 * All speech in the script is synthetic. The repo is public.
