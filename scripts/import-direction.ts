/**
 * The import-direction gate for the server's HTTP layer.
 *
 * `.claude/rules/code-health.md` ("A route lives in `routes/`") says imports
 * point one way: `server.ts` → `routes/` → everything else. Two edges break
 * that, and both had shipped before this gate existed:
 *
 *  - **routes → server.ts.** `routes/meetings-calendar.ts` imported
 *    `ServerOptions` out of `server.ts`, which imports `routes/` back. A cycle
 *    as well as an upward import, and invisible because it was `import type`
 *    — six other modules had already worked around it by hand-copying the two
 *    or three option fields they read into a structural type.
 *  - **non-route → routes.** `review-gate.ts`, a service, imported the two
 *    verdict types it PRODUCES back out of `routes/docs.ts` and
 *    `routes/task-routes-context.ts`. A shared name both a route and a service
 *    need belongs with the service; the route context re-exports it.
 *
 * `server.ts` is the one module allowed to import `routes/`, because it is the
 * router: that is what makes the direction a direction rather than a ban.
 *
 * Type-only imports count. Both edges above were `import type`, and a rule
 * that ignored them would have caught neither.
 *
 * The scan is textual on purpose. It reads import specifiers out of the
 * source, resolves them against the file's own directory, and asks which side
 * of `routes/` each end sits on. There is no build step to keep in sync and
 * nothing to configure; a new package under `packages/` is covered the moment
 * its files exist.
