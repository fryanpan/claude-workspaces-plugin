/**
 * The audit has to see a file that is not committed yet.
 *
 * `scripts/test-audit.ts` enumerates with `git ls-files`, which lists TRACKED
 * files only. A brand-new test file is untracked until somebody stages it — so
 * the gate whose entire subject is new tests was blind to exactly the files
 * being added. A builder ran it locally, read a clean table, pushed, and CI
 * went red on a sleep in the file they had just written: CI checks out the
 * commit, where the file is tracked.
 *
 * This runs the real script as a subprocess against the real repo, because the
 * enumeration IS the thing under test and a unit test of a helper would not
 * have caught it. The script does its work at module load and can call
 * `process.exit`, so it cannot be imported.
 *
 * The probe file is planted, asserted on, and removed both inline and in an
 * `afterEach`, so an assertion that throws still cleans up. It is named `.ts`
 * rather than `.test.ts` on purpose: the sleep check globs
 * `packages/server/test/*.ts`, so a plain `.ts` file qualifies without any
 * runner trying to collect it as a suite.
 *
 * Because the fixture is the working tree itself, every path below carries a
 * per-run suffix and the whole window runs under a cross-process lock — see
 * `RUN_ID` and the `beforeEach` under it. Without both, two vitest runs in one
 * checkout delete each other's probes and count each other's sites.

/**
 * The other half of surviving a concurrent run: a cleanup that cannot reach
 * another process's fixture.
 *
 * The lock keeps two runs from planting at the same time, but a run that dies
 * inside the window leaves files behind, and the run that reclaims the lock
 * sweeps them. Between those two mechanisms sits the ordinary case this covers
 * — every path is addressed by `RUN_ID`, and the one shared DIRECTORY, `dist`,
 * is released only when nothing is left in it.
 *
 * Planted inside the test rather than before it, because the `beforeEach`
 * sweep would otherwise (correctly) remove the stand-in first.
