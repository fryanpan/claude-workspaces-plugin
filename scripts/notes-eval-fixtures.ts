/**
 * Turn real meetings into scripted ticks the note-taker can be run against.
 *
 * WHY REAL MEETINGS. Every fixture elsewhere in this repo is invented, and
 * invented speech is the one thing a note-taking eval cannot use: a
 * transcript somebody wrote to be summarised is already half a summary. It
 * has no false starts, nobody talks over anybody, nothing is said twice, and
 * a model scores well on it while failing on the meeting it was built for.
 * So the corpus is AMI — a hundred hours of recorded working meetings,
 * released under CC BY 4.0, already used by `room-labels-check.ts` for the
 * same reason. Its speakers are LETTERS, so nothing here names a person.
 *
 * WHY THE FIXTURES ARE COMMITTED. The corpus is a 23 MB download and the
 * annotations are somebody else's data; CI cannot fetch them and should not
 * try. The excerpts this writes are small, attributed, and checked in, so
 * `bun run notes:eval` runs from a fresh clone with nothing but an API key.
 *
 *   bun run scripts/notes-eval-fixtures.ts            # rebuild every fixture
 *   bun run scripts/notes-eval-fixtures.ts ES2002a    # just one meeting
 *
 * The annotations must be in the cache first (once, CC BY 4.0):
 *   curl -o ~/Library/Caches/claude-workspaces/ami/ami_public_manual_1.6.2.zip \
 *     https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/AMICorpusAnnotations/ami_public_manual_1.6.2.zip
 *
 * THE TICKS ARE CUT THE WAY THE SERVER CUTS THEM. Utterances are grouped by
 * the same two clocks the live pipeline runs on — a pause of
 * `DEFAULT_NOTES_QUIET_MS`, and a ceiling of `DEFAULT_NOTES_CADENCE_MS` that
 * speech does not reset — so a fixture tick holds what a real tick would have
 * held. Cutting on a round number of sentences instead would hand the model
 * tidier units than it ever gets.

 *
 * Eight, two projects of four: ES2002 and ES2003 are separate teams running
 * the SAME design brief, which is what makes one board fit both — and what
 * makes the sample two rooms rather than one. All are from the AMI scenario
 * set: the same four people designing a
 * remote control across a series of meetings, which is as close to this
 * product's own case — a small team working a problem over weeks — as a
 * public corpus gets. The offsets skip the openings, where somebody is
 * explaining the recording equipment and one voice reads instructions: an
 * excerpt there measures nothing about note-taking while looking like a
 * result.
 *
 * THE TWO KICKOFF MEETINGS START MUCH LATER THAN THE REST. ES2002a and
 * ES2003a open with the AMI icebreaker — each person draws their favourite
 * animal on the whiteboard and talks about it for several minutes. A
 * note-taker that writes nothing there is behaving CORRECTLY, which is real
 * behaviour and useless to measure: run from 300s, those two meetings
 * produced ticks that were all correct silence, and the eval reported almost
 * no examples of anything. 900s is past the drawing and into the brief.
