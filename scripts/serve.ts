#!/usr/bin/env bun
/**
 * Starts the feedback server on a free port and prints URLs for every
 * network surface the user might want:
 *
 *   http://localhost:<port>             — this machine only
 *   http://<tailscale-host>:<port>      — any device on the tailnet
 *   http://<lan-host-or-ip>:<port>      — any device on the same wifi
 *
 * No tunnels, no DNS, no cloudflared. The project assumes the devices
 * doing the reviewing (Bryan's phone, a teammate's laptop) are on the
 * same Tailscale network or local network as the host machine.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/serve.ts [--port <n>] [--no-watch]
 *
 * Modes:
 *   default     — DEV: server runs under `bun --watch` (hot-reload on any
 *                 imported change) + a workspaces-app bundler in --watch mode.
 *   --no-watch  — PROD: rebuilds the browser bundles once, publishes them as
 *                 an immutable client release outside this checkout, and runs
 *                 the server as a plain long-lived process against it. No
 *                 bundler, no hot-reload: deploys are deliberate (git pull +
 *                 restart), and a --watch reload once left the server
 *                 alive-but-unbound and took the fleet-shared review server
 *                 down. This mode is what the launchd service runs.
 *
 * Stops cleanly on Ctrl+C.

//      the whole fleet, and made the served client track whichever commit the
