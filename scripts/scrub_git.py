"""What a push actually makes public — the range both scrub layers scan.

Shared by `scrub-check.py` (regex) and `scrub-haiku.py` (AI), so the two
layers can never drift into asking different questions about the same push.

**The question this answers, and the one it replaces.** The hook used to hand
each layer `git diff <remote_sha>..<local_sha>` — a comparison of two TREES.
When the pushed tip is a merge of `main`, every line `main` gained since the
branch point is an *addition* in that comparison, even though it has been
public on `origin/main` for days. Measured on this repo: a branch whose own
change was two README lines presented 7,516 insertions across 64 files, and
the Haiku layer flagged content it had already let through. Since the
conventions tell every branch to merge `main` before its final push, the gate
fired on the normal path and the only available response was `SCRUB_SKIP=1` —
the exact dynamic recorded in learnings.md under "A false positive on a
REMOVAL is the worst false positive available", one level up.

So ask about COMMITS, not trees: everything reachable from the pushed tip that
is not reachable from a ref the remote already has. A commit drops out only
when it is already public, so this can only ever remove false positives — it
cannot hide a new addition.

Two details that are load-bearing rather than stylistic:

- **`--cc` on `git log --patch`.** By default `git log -p` prints NO diff for a
  merge commit, and a merge is exactly where conflict resolution can introduce
  text present in neither parent. Probed both ways: with `--cc` a string
  written during a conflict resolution appears; without it, it does not. Drop
  `--cc` and this "fix" starts hiding real leaks in the one commit type it was
  written for.
- **Remote-tracking refs are the definition of "already public".** They can be
  stale (nobody fetched), and then some already-public commit is scanned
  again. That failure mode is the status quo — a false positive — never a miss.

    The narrower `redact_public_identities` below fixed the same class of
    false positive one layer up (PR #198): the gate flagged the commit author
    trailer of every already-public commit. This is that fix for prose. A
    maintainer's own name in their own public repository's documentation is
    not a leak — it is already in hundreds of tracked files — but the scanner
    was told it was safe only in standard metadata, so every documentation
    change that quoted them by name failed the push, and the only exits were
    to redact their own words or switch the gate off. A gate that fires on
    the normal path trains people to bypass it.

    Two conditions, and the intersection is the point:

    * the name is the identity this checkout commits under, so it names the
      person doing the pushing rather than anyone they wrote about; and
    * this repository has already published commits under it, so setting
      `user.name` to a colleague's name buys no exemption — they would have
      to be a published author here already.

    Once the full name qualifies, the exemption covers the person pushing in
    the forms they are actually written: the full name, its first word, and
    their account handle. A decision record quotes a maintainer by first name
    far more often than by full name, and the full name alone left the
    scanner blocking those: a window audit counted 21 flagged commits whose
    only names were the maintainer's. Neither short form is checked on its
    own — both hang off the same qualifying full name, so a checkout that
    earns nothing still earns nothing.

    The handle is the account that owns `origin`, and only when a commit
    already published under the qualifying name carries an email naming that
    same account. The owner of `origin` is often an organisation or somebody
    else's repository, and a remote URL alone says nothing about who is
    pushing to it; the published email is what ties the account to the
    person.

    Empty set means no exemption and the scanner behaves exactly as before,
    which is what CI and any fresh clone get.
