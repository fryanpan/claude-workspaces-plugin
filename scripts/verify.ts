/**
 * `bun run verify` — every gate CI runs, in one command.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. CLAUDE.md used to hand builders "the four gates" and list
 * four commands. CI's `verify` job runs fifteen. A builder on PR 744 ran all
 * four, pushed, and went red on `loc:audit` because a doc comment had taken a
 * file from 496 to 504 lines — then ran four more checks by hand, found them
 * clean, and reported that the list was short. It was short by seven.
 *
 * A hand-maintained list of gates drifts the moment somebody adds a CI step.
 * So this file is the list, and `--parity` is the thing that keeps it true:
 * it reads .github/workflows/ci.yml and fails if CI runs a `bun run` that no
 * member here covers, or if a member claims a gate CI does not run. Parity is
 * itself the first member, and it is also a CI step — so the next person to
 * add a gate to CI learns about this file from a red build rather than from
 * a stale paragraph.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO. It will not report a pass while a member failed. Every
 * member's exit code is recorded (a signal-killed member counts as a failure,
 * not as a null that reads like zero), nothing is piped anywhere — `| tail`
 * would replace the member's status with tail's — and the process exits
 * non-zero if any member did. Output is INHERITED, not captured: a failing
 * member prints its own diagnostics to your terminal exactly as it would if
 * you had run it yourself, and the summary at the end is an index into that
 * scrollback, never a replacement for it.
 *
 * ORDER. CI's order is not this order. CI runs the suites in jobs of their
 * own because its steps are its own report; here the members are sorted
 * cheapest-first, so a broken `loc:audit` costs twenty seconds instead of
 * seven minutes. What is enforced is identical — parity checks the SET, not
 * the sequence. The one ordering that is not cosmetic is the last three:
 * `test:vitest` and `test:server` run UNDER coverage instrumentation and
 * leave their lcov in `.coverage/`, and `coverage` then ratchets what they
 * left. The suites used to run twice — once plain, once again inside the
 * coverage step — which was half of this command's wall clock and all of
 * CI's; each now runs once and answers both questions.
 *
 * PARITY ACROSS JOBS. ci.yml is four jobs now (`gates`, `client`, `server`,
 * `coverage`) plus the note-taking slice. `--parity` reads all of them except
 * the ones named in NON_GATE_JOBS, so a gate added to a NEW job is covered by
 * the same check that covers a gate added to an old one — a parity check
 * pinned to one job name would have gone quietly vacuous the moment CI was
 * split.
 *
 *   bun run verify                  every member, ~4 min, all failures reported
 *   bun run verify --bail           stop at the first failure
 *   bun run verify --only lint,typecheck
 *   bun run verify --list           print the members and exit
 *   bun run verify --parity         only the CI-parity check (instant)
 *   bun run verify --base <ref>     base for the two diff-against-base gates
