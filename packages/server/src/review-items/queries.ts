/**
 * Is this item an ask the READER can actually see and act on?
 *
 * The stall clock parks a row while `reviewState.open` is above zero, on the
 * reading that the row is legitimately waiting on a person. That is only true
 * of items the person has in front of them, so this predicate has to agree
 * with the Home queue's own filter (`review-queue.ts`) item for item. When the
 * two drift, the row parks forever on an ask that is off the queue: nobody can
 * answer it, so nothing ever clears it, and the watchdog stays off the row.
 *
 * Four exclusions, and each one is the queue's:
 *
 *  - ANSWERED (`isReviewItemOpen`) — settled.
 *  - GATED — held or still being judged; the reader was never shown it.
 *  - WITHDRAWN — its asker took it back, so no decision was ever needed.
 *  - WAITING — the reader asked back and it is the OWNER's turn; the row is
 *    the one holding things up, which is the opposite of waiting on a person.
 *
 * The predicates are reused rather than re-derived for exactly that reason: a
 * second spelling of "on the queue" is free to disagree with the first, and
 * this bug is what that disagreement costs. Exported so the stall wiring
 * reads the same predicate when it names the items a row waits on.

   * Every review item on a ticket, in order.

   * When the ticket IS a legacy decision, one derived row leads the list with
   * the fixed id `r-legacy`. The derivation happens at READ time and writes
   * nothing: it is idempotent by construction and cannot double-apply across a
   * restart, which is strictly safer than the lazy back-fill `hydrateFromDisk`
   * does for `unplacedSince`. Nothing is purged either — `needs`, `options`,
   * `answer` and `infoRequests` keep being read and written exactly as before.
   *
   * Real rows do NOT suppress the derived one, and that is a correction rather
   * than a preference. Suppressing on "a stored row exists" keys the decision
   * on the wrong fact: the legacy decision is a SEPARATE open question from
   * whatever somebody filed later, so the moment a ticket gained its second
   * question the first one silently left this list — and with it `GET
   * /review-items`, which is the one route that answers "what is waiting on
   * me". The derived row leaves for exactly one reason now: the decision was
   * answered, at which point it is still LISTED and merely closed.
   *
   * It leads rather than trails because it is the oldest question on the
   * ticket (`createdAt` is the task's own), and this queue is oldest-first.
   *
   * Rows are read through `readTaskReviewItem`, so a row corrupted on disk
   * drops out of the list instead of throwing inside a renderer that never
   * touched this ticket — and because the derived row no longer depends on how
   * many raw rows there are, an unreadable one can no longer take the legacy
   * decision down with it.
