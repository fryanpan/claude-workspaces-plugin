 * Home decision card off the projection rather than off `GET /review-items`.
 * One derivation, so the queue route and the projection cannot disagree
 * about whether a decision is waiting on its owner.
 *
 * `needs === 'decision'` is the WHOLE condition. It used to also require
 * that no stored row existed, which made an unanswered decision disappear
 * from every reader as soon as somebody filed a second question on the same
 * ticket — see `listReviewItems` for why that is the wrong key.
 *
 * What is carried across, beyond `reviewFromDecisionTask`'s payload: the
 * task's own clock and filer, the legacy `answer` (an answered decision read
 * as open is a queue that never empties), the info requests WITH their
 * threads (a threaded one is what reads as `waiting`), and the decision's
 * revisions (what reads as `revised`).
