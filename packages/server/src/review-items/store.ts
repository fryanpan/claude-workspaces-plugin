/**
 * The 0..n review items filed ON a ticket — asking, answering, asking for
 * more, rewriting the ask, and taking it back.
 *
 * Lifted out of `TaskStore` whole. These verbs used to sit in the middle of
 * an 8,000-line class, sharing a `this` with goals, attachments, voice queues
 * and the sidecar writer — so nothing stopped one reaching for any of them,
 * and nothing said which of them it actually needed. Now that answer is the
 * nine-member `ReviewItemPersistence` this module declares itself, and a test
 * can hand it a plain object.
 *
 * The `r-legacy` row is not one of these: it is DERIVED from a legacy
 * decision's own fields, so the two verbs that accept it hand it straight to
 * `TaskDecisionStore` rather than growing a second implementation of
 * "record a decision's answer" free to drift from the first.

   * are the CALLER'S — `checkReviewPayload` already demands they exist and be
   * unique within the item, and re-minting them would break an `answeredWith`
   * a client had already put on screen. Only the item id is minted here,
   * `r-<crypto>`, the way options mint `o-<crypto>`.
