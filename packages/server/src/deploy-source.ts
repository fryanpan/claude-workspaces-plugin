/**
 * What the deploy source was parked on when a client release was built — the
 * `sourceRef` stamped into `releases/<id>/release.json`.
 *
 * ## Why the marker is not simply `git describe --always --dirty`
 *
 * It was, and the suffix stopped meaning anything. Prod's deploy source is the
 * primary checkout, and that checkout also hosts **bound attachments**:
 * markdown files under `docs/` that are attached to a live doc, so every agent
 * edit flushes back to the file ~1s later. Once such a file is also *tracked*
 * (which is a thing this repo deliberately does more of), the checkout has a
 * modified tracked file for as long as the review is open, and every release
 * published in that window is stamped `-dirty` for a reason that has nothing to
 * do with the build. Observed, both directions, on 2026-08-17: `0ef5d92-dirty`
 * while a bound plan was mid-edit, `a822618` three minutes later once the same
 * checkout went clean, same server and same build path.
 *
 * `-dirty` exists to answer one question — *was what this box is serving built
 * from committed code?* A marker that also fires on ordinary document editing
 * is a marker people learn to skip, which is the failure the client-drift alarm
 * already has an arming rule to avoid.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A modified tracked path sets `-dirty` **unless it is documentation that this
 * deploy neither builds nor serves.** That is an explicit, short IGNORE list —
 * `docs/**` and top-level `*.md` — and everything not on it counts.
 *
 * The direction matters more than the contents. Enumerating "paths that can
 * affect the build" and missing one reports a release built from uncommitted
 * code as clean, which is the failure the marker exists to prevent. Enumerating
 * "paths that provably cannot" and missing one reports `-dirty` on a release
 * that was fine — noise. So the list is an ignore list, defaults are to mark,
 * and adding an entry is a deliberate act with this paragraph attached.
 *
 * Two facts fix the current entries, and both should be re-checked before the
 * list grows:
 *
 * - Nothing builds or serves `docs/`. It is not read by either bundle build
 *   (`packages/{widget,workspaces-app}/scripts/build.ts`) and no route reads it.
 * - `demos/` **is** served, live, out of the deploy source — `bin.ts` resolves
 *   `join(repoRoot, 'demos')` and `server.ts` serves `/demos/*` per request. So
 *   an uncommitted demo genuinely changes what a browser gets, and `demos/`
 *   stays on the marking side even though it holds bound attachments too.
 *   "It is a bound doc" is therefore NOT the criterion; "this deploy does not
 *   build or serve it" is.
 *
 * ## And it says WHICH paths
 *
 * A bare suffix cannot be judged by the person reading it later. The provenance
 * also carries `dirtyPaths` — every modified tracked path, not only the ones
 * that set the suffix — so `sourceRef: "a822618"` next to
 * `dirtyPaths: ["docs/product/plans/x.md"]` reads as "the tree was not pristine
 * and here is why that did not count", and a `-dirty` release names the file
 * that earned it.
