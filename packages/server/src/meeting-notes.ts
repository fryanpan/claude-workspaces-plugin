/**
 * Meeting notes on two clocks: the quiet detector, the cadence ceiling, the
 * composer seam, and the per-meeting session that joins them.
 *
 * WHY A PAUSE IS THE UNIT. Notes composed per turn would interrupt a thought
 * mid-argument; notes composed at the end would arrive after the meeting they
 * were for. A pause in speech is the moment a human note-taker writes, so the
 * detector watches the transcript stream — EVERY frame, partials included,
 * because a partial is speech in progress and therefore evidence there is no
 * pause — and fires only when the stream has been quiet for the threshold.
 *
 * WHY A PAUSE IS NOT THE ONLY UNIT (owner, 2026-08-30: "waits too long to
 * update notes"). Every frame REPLACES the quiet countdown, so a conversation
 * where nobody stops for the threshold never fires one — and the meeting that
 * most needs notes, the one where people are talking without a break, was
 * exactly the meeting that produced nothing until it ended. The cadence timer
 * is the ceiling on that: it starts when the first unwritten sentence settles
 * and is NOT reset by speech, so no finished sentence waits longer than
 * `cadenceMs` to reach the doc. The two clocks are additive and whichever
 * expires first fires the tick.
 *
 * WHY A CADENCE TICK CARRIES ONLY SETTLED TURNS. The words still in flight
 * are a partial, and this engine's partials are UNFORMATTED — no punctuation,
 * no sentence casing, which arrive only when the turn settles (see
 * `format_turns` in the architecture summary). So there is no such thing as a
 * finished sentence inside a partial to cut at: a settled turn IS the unit of
 * finished speech, and the turn being spoken waits for the next tick rather
 * than being written mid-clause.
 *
 * WHY THE COMPOSER IS A SEAM WITH NO DEFAULT. The real composer is an LLM
 * call; same rule as `transcribe.ts` and the summarizer — `createServer` must
 * be constructible without anything that can reach the network. Only the
 * caller that starts the real server wires a real composer; tests wire the
 *
 * deterministic stub below.
 *
 * WHY THE COMPOSER RETURNS THE WHOLE NOTES, NOT A DELTA. Same shape as the
 * turn-shaped engine contract: notes are REVISED as a meeting develops — a
 * decision gets overturned ten minutes after it was noted — and a delta-only
 * contract could never take anything back. The input carries `previous` so a
 * composer that merely appends can, and one that restructures may.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE RIDES SSE. A tick per pause is word-rate-adjacent; ticks and
 * composed notes go to the injected `onNotes` sink only, and the stage that
 * writes them into the doc decides delivery (the CRDT, not the event hub).
