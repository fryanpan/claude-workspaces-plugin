/**
 * The Home pane's "What's New?" brief: what happened on a workspace since a
 * PERSON last marked themselves caught up, plus the read marker itself and
 * the editable instructions the generator writes under.
 *
 * Decisions this encodes (Bryan, 2026-08-18, on the approved home-pane
 * mockup — docs/product/mockups/home-pane, branch design/home-pane):
 *  - Summaries always cover everything since last marked read; there is no
 *    coverage-scope selector.
 *  - "Mark caught up" records a READ TIMESTAMP, per account, not per device.
 *    The next visit generates an updated summary from that point.
 *  - Regeneration is instruction-driven: edit the instructions and they are
 *    used on this summary and future summaries.
 *
 * The shape of the module follows the thread summarizer split: everything
 * pure (the deterministic brief, the prompt, staleness) is exported and
 * table-testable; the one thing that can reach the network lives on
 * `ThreadSummarizer.generateHomeBrief`, behind the same constructor seam —
 * no test run and no `bun run staging` can call the real API, because only
 * `bin.ts` ever constructs a summarizer with a key.
 *
 * "Per account" here means per NAME. Identity on these surfaces is the name
 * a person types at the who's-reviewing prompt; it is the one identifier
 * that is the same on their phone and their laptop, which is exactly the
 * case the per-account decision names (read on the phone, then the desktop).

/**
 * Drop each answer that a later withdrawal on the same task took back, and

 * the answered row stood alone and the brief asserted a decision the board
 * no longer held. An answer and its undo are one non-event to a reader who
 * has been away: nothing was decided, and saying "answered, then withdrawn"
 * is bookkeeping they did not ask for.
 *
 * A withdrawal clears EVERY standing task-level answer on its task, not the
 * newest alone. Answering twice overwrites — `answerDecision` moves the
 * first answer into history — and `withdrawAnswer` does not bring it back,
 * so after answer, answer, undo the ticket is OPEN, and a brief that kept
 * the first answer would report it decided. An answer given after the undo
 * is untouched.
 *
 * The withdrawal itself drops only when every answer it cleared was given
 * after `since` — an answer and its undo the reader was away for is one
 * non-event. When any cleared answer STOOD before the reader left (given at
 * or before `since`, even if overwritten since), the ticket they last saw
 * decided is open again, and the withdrawal stays as that reopening. So does
 * a withdrawal with nothing to clear at all: the log may not reach back to
 * the answer, and "reopened" is still the true state.
 *
 * Only the TASK-LEVEL answer can be withdrawn — `withdrawAnswer` undoes the
 * legacy `answer_decision` record and nothing else — and only that answer's
 * event arrives without a `reviewItemId` (`answerTaskReview` stamps one on
 * every real row it answers, and delegates the derived legacy row to
 * `answerDecision`, which stamps none). So a withdrawal pairs with the
 * newest standing row-less answer on its task, and an answered review item
 * on the same ticket is left standing: pairing by task alone popped the
 * review item's answer instead and kept reporting the withdrawn one.
