/**
 * ── Home pane: per-person read markers + the "What's New?" brief ────────────
 *
 * (Approved design: docs/product/mockups/home-pane. Summaries cover
 * everything since the reader last marked caught up; instructions are
 * workspace-wide and editable; generation is the summarizer seam or
 * nothing — a server with no summarizer serves the deterministic brief.)
 *
 * One module because this is one question asked twice: what one person sees
 * on one board's Home tab, and what the brief may CLAIM about it.
 * `reviewItemsFor` is what makes it a family rather than a pile — the queue
 * it builds is both the list `GET /review-items` renders and the denominator
 * `homeQueueTotal` prints, so the number the brief closes with cannot drift
 * from the list drawn under it. Splitting those two apart would be two
 * readings of "what is waiting on me" with nothing asserting they agree.
 *
 * The context is explicit, the same shape `board-membership.ts` and
 * `stall-wiring.ts` use, and every member of it is a VALUE: nothing here is
 * built later than the stores it reads, so `createServer` composes this
 * wherever the stores, the doc store and the summarizer seam are already in hand.
 *
 * `homeBriefInflight`, `homeBriefInput` and `generateHomeBriefFor` stay
 * internal: nothing outside this module reached them inside `createServer`
 * either, and the in-flight set is only correct if exactly one thing owns it.

  /**
   * How many items the Home queue holds right now. Feeds only the brief's
   * closing "is anything waiting" line.
   *
   * The number is a promise about the LIST rendered under it, so it counts
   * exactly what the browser's `reviewQueue` places and nothing else:
   *
   *  - comment-borne review rows (`task-thread` / `doc-thread`) — ALL of
   *    them, which is true again since 2026-08-21: membership moved into
   *    `reviewThreadItems` (a row is a declared item or a surviving direct
   *    ask), and the browser retired its undeclared shelf and places every
   *    row this route ships. Between those two changes this count briefly
   *    included inferred rows Home never drew — "something needs you" over a
   *    list that showed nothing,
   *  - open decisions, which Home draws from the board projection as its own
   *    `decision` rows.
   *
   * Person-owned blockers are deliberately NOT a term. A blocker is task
   * state, not a review item — the browser's `reviewQueue` stopped placing
   * blocker rows when the task panel's blocked note took them over, so a
   * count that still included them pointed the brief ("queued below") at a
   * queue that renders nothing.
   *
   * TICKET-borne rows (`kind: 'task-review'`) count too — Home places them
   * now (`reviewQueue` in board-review-model.ts), which closed the measured gap where
   * a review item filed with `create_tasks` / `add_review_item` was shipped
   * by the route and rendered by nothing. The one exception is the DERIVED
   * `r-legacy` row: its legacy decision is already counted from the tasks
   * below, and the browser skips that row for the same reason, so counting
   * it here would say one question twice.
   *
   * The open-decision term is counted from the TASKS rather than from `items`,
   * even though `items` also carries a derived `r-legacy` row per open
   * decision. Same reason: `decisionQueue` in the browser is what draws those
   * rows, and it reads `needs`/`answer` off the projection. Counting the
   * derived rows instead would tie this number to a row Home does not read.
   * A decision is therefore counted once, never twice.
