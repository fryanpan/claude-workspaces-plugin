/**
 * Deploying this server — pull the deploy source, then restart it.
 *
 * ## Why it is one operation and not two
 *
 * On 2026-08-17 prod ran 24 commits behind for about ten hours and nothing
 * said so. Two reports that read as bugs in `main` were the stale server:
 * `set_goal_list` rejecting a payload the merged code accepts, and
 * `update_task_body` taking a `title`, answering 200, and keeping the old
 * one. Both returned success, which is what made them expensive.
 *
 * Deploying required a person with a shell in the primary checkout. This is
 * that person's two commands, minus the person.
 *
 * **The ordering is structural rather than documented.** `Deployer` exposes
 * exactly one verb, and it always fetches first. There is deliberately no way
 * to ask for a restart on its own, because a restart re-runs
 * `scripts/serve.ts --no-watch` out of the deploy source's WorkingDirectory —
 * so a restart over an unpulled checkout rebuilds the *same* bundles,
 * republishes the *same* client, prints a successful deploy line, and changes
 * nothing. That is the failure this module exists to remove, and a comment
 * saying "always pull first" is exactly the kind of instruction that gets
 * skipped at 2am. So it is not expressible.
 *
 * ## What it will not do
 *
 * Only a fast-forward. Never a rebase, never a reset, never a force. `ahead >
 * 0` on the deploy source means somebody committed there and has not pushed;
 * the honest answer is to name it and stop, because every mechanism that
 * would "fix" it destroys their commit. The pull is `fetch` + `merge
 * --ff-only` rather than `git pull`, which does whatever `pull.rebase`
 * happens to say on this machine.
 *
 * ## What "already deployed" means
 *
 * Not "the checkout is at origin's tip". A deploy delivers a browser client,
 * and that client is rebuilt by the restart — so the question is whether the
 * SERVED release was built from what the checkout is on now, which is exactly
 * what `release.json`'s `sourceRef` records. A source somebody pulled by hand
 * and did not restart is current by git and stale by the only measure a
 * reader cares about. It gets a restart; a source whose served client matches
 * gets left alone.
 *
 * ## What it reports
 *
 * The ref before and after, both READ from the checkout with
 * `readDeploySource`, never parsed out of git's own chatter — the same
 * discipline `PluginRefresher` uses, and for the same reason: a command that
 * reports success while copying nothing is how a delivery gap hides.
 *
 * ## Dependencies are part of the delivery
 *
 * On 2026-08-30 a PR added a package; the deploy pulled, restarted, and the
 * server booted into a missing-import crash — while the deploy answered 200
 * and `release.json` advanced, because the bundles built fine before the
 * server process died. Two changes close that gap, and each one alone is not
 * enough:
 *
 * - `bun install --frozen-lockfile` runs before EVERY restart this module
 *   schedules, not only when the pull touched `bun.lock`. Gating on the
 *   lockfile misses the recovery case (a pull whose install failed leaves the
 *   next deploy seeing nothing to pull) and the hand-pulled case
 *   (restart-only over a checkout somebody updated without installing).
 *   Frozen, because a deploy installs exactly what was merged — an install
 *   that would rewrite `bun.lock` in the deploy source is a broken merge, not
 *   something to paper over. A failed install refuses the restart outright:
 *   `install-failed`, and the server keeps running on the code it has.
 *
 * - A restart is recorded as an INTENT, not a success. The result carries
 *   `verification: pending` with a deadline; the restarted server confirms
 *   its own boot (`confirmDeployBoot`, called from `bin.ts` once it is
 *   actually serving), and a detached watchdog (`deploy-verify.ts`, spawned
 *   alongside the restart precisely because the restart kills the process
 *   that could otherwise check) marks the record `boot-failed` if the
 *   deadline passes with no confirmation. `GET /api/deploy` reads the
 *   verdict; a pending record past its deadline reads as failed even if the
 *   watchdog never got to write.

/**
 * What this deploy is allowed to do to the deploy source.
 *
 * Order matters: divergence is checked before dirt, because a checkout that
 * is both diverged and dirty has the worse problem, and reporting the dirt
 * would send someone off to stash files when the real issue is an unpushed
 * commit.
 *
 * A modified path blocks only when the pull would rewrite that same path.
 * A blanket "refuse while dirty" was the first shape and it is unusable
 * here: the deploy source hosts bound attachments, so tracked files
 * under `docs/` are modified for hours during ordinary editing (see
 * `deploy-source.ts` for the measurement). It is also the rule git itself
 * applies — `merge --ff-only` refuses exactly when an incoming change
 * touches a locally-modified file — so refusing on the intersection means we
 * refuse where git would, with a message that names the file.
 *
 * ## "Up-to-date" is served-vs-HEAD, not git-vs-origin
 *
 * `behind === 0` answers "is the CHECKOUT current", and that was never the
 * question. A deploy delivers a browser client, and the client is rebuilt by
 * the restart — so a checkout somebody pulled by hand and did not restart is
 * at origin's tip while the fleet is still loading the bundle built from the
 * older commit. Answering `up-to-date` there both refuses to restart and
 * reports the gap as absent, which is the same shape as the ten-hour stale
 * prod this module was written for: a successful-looking answer with the
 * delivery still undone.
 *
 * So `up-to-date` requires BOTH — nothing to pull and a served client built
 * from what the checkout is on. Nothing to pull with an older client is
 * `restart-only`: no merge, no files touched, just the restart that rebuilds
 * and republishes.
