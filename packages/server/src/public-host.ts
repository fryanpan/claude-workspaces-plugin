/**
 * The operator-declared external base URL, normalized — or null when unset.
 *
 * The server does not terminate TLS. When something in front of it does
 * (`tailscale serve` maps `https://<tailnet-name>` onto this process on
 * loopback), the process has no way to learn its own external origin: the
 * socket is plain http, and the only hostname it can discover is the one it
 * would have guessed anyway. So the operator states it, and every URL the
 * server hands a human is built from it.
 *
 * This matters more than cosmetics. `publicBaseUrl` is the single source of
 * `reviewUrl`, `entryUrl` and the task-import banner's `hubUrl` — the links
 * agents paste to Bryan. Left at `http://<host>:<port>` behind a TLS
 * frontend, every one of those links lands on the INSECURE origin, which is
 * exactly the origin where the microphone does not exist. The whole point of
 * putting TLS in front is undone by the links still pointing past it.
 *
 * Strict, and it THROWS rather than falling back. A silent fallback here is
 * the "fallback nobody knows they are on" failure: the server would keep
 * serving, every link would keep working, and they would all quietly point
 * at the origin the deploy was meant to leave behind. A typo must be a boot
 * failure someone reads, not a degradation nobody sees.
 *
 * Rejected on purpose:
 *   - a scheme other than http/https — nothing else is a browser origin
 *   - a path, query or fragment — routes mount at the root, and a base with
 *     a path would build `https://h/x/review/<id>`, which this server does
 *     not serve
 *   - embedded credentials — these strings are pasted to humans
