/**
 * Who wrote which line, and what an agent write is allowed to touch.

 * delete or replace only what the AGENT wrote. There is no per-character
 * provenance in a Yjs doc, so ownership is a LEDGER keyed by the ELEMENT,
 * holding the markdown this module left in it. An item is the agent's only if
 * it is an element the agent wrote AND it still reads exactly as the agent
 * left it. Both halves are load-bearing: text alone would hand a person's
 * element to the agent the moment they typed a line matching one of its own,
 * and element alone would keep calling a line the agent's after they rewrote
 * it.
 *
 * The ledger is the guard, and it is structural rather than a prompt — no
 * wording the composer returns can reach a human's item. What a write DOES
 * with the answer is `meeting-notes-merge.ts`.
