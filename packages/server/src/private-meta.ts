 * `redactMetaForVisitor` strips these from `GET /api/docs/<id>`, but that only
 * closed half the door: they also lived in the Yjs `meta` map, and the server
 * hands the whole CRDT to anyone who opens `/y/<docId>` — share visitors
 * included. A visitor holding one link could read Bryan's filesystem layout,
 * his private repo names, and which agent produced the doc straight off the
 * sync channel, no matter what REST returned.
 *
 * Yjs can't withhold part of a doc from one peer: sync is a state exchange,
 * not a per-connection projection. So these keys leave the CRDT entirely and
 * live in a sidecar next to the `.ydoc`. Nothing on the client ever read their
 * values (only `code-app.ts` touched `sourceUrl`, as a fallback for picking a
 * syntax-highlighting language — the redacted REST payload supplies a
 * basename `relPath` for exactly that), so the move is server-internal.
