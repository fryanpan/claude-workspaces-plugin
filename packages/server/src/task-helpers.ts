 * `task-owner.ts` already are — `task-persistence.ts` needs both and may not
 * import a VALUE from the file that imports it, the same rule `task-agents.ts`
 * and `workspace-store.ts` follow for their own pure helpers. `tasks.ts`
 * imports them back and re-exports them, so no caller outside either file
 * changes.
 *
 * The verb-family split added the four those modules need, for the same reason:
 * `task-authoring.ts` mints a status with `initialTaskStatus`,
 * `task-lifecycle.ts` reads the row discriminator with `isGoalRow`, and
 * `task-links.ts` validates and keys every `Ref` — three predicates that were
 * already pure, already exported, and already had no reader inside the store
 * class.
