/**
 * Does this text ask one of `people` something — as opposed to thinking out
 * loud, which is what most agent prose containing a "?" is doing.
 *
 * The rule is a question mark AND a direct address: the person's name at the
 * start of a line or an emphasis run, followed by the punctuation an address
 * takes. Both halves are load-bearing, and both were measured over all 86 agent
 * comments on this project's board rather than reasoned about:
 *
 * - `?` alone fires on **19 of 86**. The sample is URL query strings
 *   (`…/workspaces/w-…?t=`), code (`` `in listUntriaged?` ``), optional
 *   chaining (`anchor.snippet?.`), section headings, and quoted UI copy. This
 *   is the "agent comments are full of rhetorical questions" the board's own
 *   task warned about, and it is why a bare interrogative rule is unusable.
 * - Address alone fires on 2 of 86.
 * - Both together fire on **1 of 86** — exactly the comment the fixture task
 *   names, and nothing else.
 *
 * **False negatives, measured: 2 of 3 real questions.** "when a person creates
 * a task from the board, who should own it by default?" and "Want a follow-up
 * PR that's purely typography?" are genuine asks that never name a person, and
 * this rule misses both. Since 2026-08-21 that miss costs the ROW — this
 * matcher is the inferred band's membership test, so a question it cannot see
 * does not surface at all. That trade was chosen with eyes open (an agent's
 * reply is not an ask): under the old rule those questions surfaced only as
 * two rows in a 60-row pile of status notes, which is not surfacing in any
 * sense that matters, and an agent that needs certainty has the declared path
 * — attach a Review Item and membership stops depending on prose at all. The
 * cost of the opposite failure is the thing the board cannot afford: a strip
 * padded with non-decisions is a strip nobody reads, and once nobody reads it
 * every real decision on it is lost too.
 *
 * `people` is who has actually spoken as a person in this workspace. A
 * workspace where nobody has yet answers no to everything — and since this
 * matcher became the inferred band's membership test, that means an empty
 * roster empties the inferred band entirely: no inferred row exists until a
 * person first speaks. Matching is exact and case-sensitive on the stored
 * name, so a short form ("Bryan" for a roster's "Bryan Chan") or a lowercase
 * address misses too, and the miss now costs the row rather than a label.
 * Both are accepted the same way the 2-of-3 recall trade above was: the
 * declared path does not depend on the roster or on prose, and it is the
 * escape hatch an agent uses when the ask must surface.

 * ONE matcher, because the detector and the extractor have to agree about which
 * span they are talking about. Two hand-written regexes that must stay in step
 * is a bug generator, and it produced one immediately: the extractor's copy had
 * dropped the newline branch, so a comment the detector accepted could fall
 * back to clipping from character zero and cut the question off — the exact
 * failure this change exists to fix, one layer down.
 *
 * Three conditions, all necessary. The measurements behind them are in
 * `asksPerson`'s note above.
 *  1. A direct ADDRESS: the name at a line start or just inside an emphasis
 *     run, then the punctuation an address takes. The small leading allowance
 *     admits "**Bryan —**" and "OK Bryan:" while still refusing a name buried
 *     mid-sentence ("which is Bryan's call"), which is the distinction the
 *     whole rule turns on.
 *  2. The question comes AFTER the address and in the same paragraph. Asking
 *     merely that a "?" exist somewhere in the comment let a status note that
 *     happens to link `…/board?tab=open` be announced as a question.
 *  3. It is a SENTENCE-ending "?" — followed by whitespace or the end of the
 *     text. This is what separates a question from a URL query string,
 *     `anchor.snippet?.text`, and a "?" inside quoted or fenced copy, which is
 *     what nearly every false positive in the corpus turned out to be.
