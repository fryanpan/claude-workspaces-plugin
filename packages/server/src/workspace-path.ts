/**
 * How a canonical workspace path is read — one parser, so every route that
 * lives under `/workspaces/<workspaceId>/…` reads the id out of the same
 * place.
 *
 * The route inventory's shape is the Google API design guide's: a resource a
 * workspace owns is addressed under the workspace that owns it, so the
 * workspace id is a PATH SEGMENT rather than something the server looks up
 * from a doc, task or set id. That is what makes it possible for one guard to
 * answer the access question before a handler runs — the guard reads paths,
 * and a path that does not name its workspace has nothing for it to read.
 *
 * Two collections live at this shape today (the board's live event stream and
 * the agent roster), moved here because their old addresses collided with the
 * nouns the glossary reserves: `/events/workspace/<id>` sat beside the
 * activity feed's `events`, and the agent roster sat on `attachments`, which
 * the glossary spends on docs, mockups, previews and diffs. The rest of the
 * REST surface still addresses resources by their own id and resolves the
 * board behind the route; when it moves, it moves to this parser.
 *
 * `matchWorkspaceRoute` is deliberately dumb: it decodes the workspace
 * segment and hands back the remainder. It answers no question about whether
 * that workspace exists or whether the caller may reach it — the store
 * answers the first and `shareScopeAllows` the second, and folding either in
 * here would put two rules where the guard expects one.
