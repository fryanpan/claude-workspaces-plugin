/**
 * The folders a board's lead may bind (`board-socket-roots.json` in the data
 * folder): one list per board, each folder resolved through its links.
 *
 * A lead behind the board wall asks for a folder bind over its board's
 * socket (`middleware/lead-scope.ts`), and the server, which no sandbox
 * holds, is what reads the files. So without this list a lead could have the
 * server publish onto its board a folder its own profile denies it: another
 * lead's project, or a key folder. A bind from a lead is refused unless the
 * folder, resolved, is one of these or inside one. With no list for a board,
 * every such bind is refused.
 *
 * `scripts/lead-sandbox.ts` writes the list when it launches a walled lead,
 * from the projects that lead's profile already opens to it, through
 * `PUT /api/board-sockets/<board>/roots` (`routes/board-socket-roots.ts`),
 * which only a caller on this machine outside any sandbox can reach. The
 * file holds paths, no secret, and is written mode 600.
