/**
 * Voice routing (§2.4 / §3.8): every utterance is classified — does this
 * change something, or just look something up? — and answered.
 *
 *  - Lookups take the Haiku FAST PATH, on the server: the classification call
 *    carries a compact workspace index (tasks, docs, goals) and the model
 *    names the target; the server validates the id and answers with a
 *    navigation. No full-agent round trip; works with no agent attached.
 *    A lookup the server cannot resolve is NOT answered here: it falls to
 *    the LEAD agent like a change (below), because "nothing matched" was a
 *    dead end nobody heard. Only an empty lead seat may fail it, and then
 *    the ack says how to fill the seat.
 *  - A small ACTION set applied to the RESOURCE IN VIEW runs here too, on the
 *    speaker's own authority: status, assignee, a comment, an answer to the
 *    one open review item, and opening a linked doc. Every one of them goes
 *    through the same store choke point the REST routes use — `transition`,
 *    `setAssignee`, `postComment`, `answerReviewItem` — so a spoken act is
 *    attributed, audited and broadcast exactly like a tapped one, and this
 *    file adds no write path and no audit surface of its own.
 *    `resolveVoiceAction` is the guardrail and it refuses far more than it
 *    allows.
 *  - Everything else — every other change, and any action the guardrail or
 *    the store declined — belongs to the ATTACHED WORKSPACE AGENT, carrying
 *    the transcript VERBATIM: the `voice.request` event rides the workspace
 *    channel the MCP watch already formats. With no live attachment the
 *    request is queued on disk and delivered in the next attach result.
 *
 * **Voice always answers.** Every path out of `handle()` produces an ack that
 * names what was heard and which route handles it — including "agent away —
 * queued" — and every utterance emits `voice.request` (§3.6), so the promise
 * has a checkable artifact.
 *
 * The network half follows the summarizer's rules exactly (summarize.ts):
 * the fast path is opt-in at the seam — `createServer` builds NO default
 * completer, so nothing that merely spins a server up can reach the network;
 * only bin.ts constructs the real one, and only the DEDICATED keychain entry
 * counts as consent for server→Anthropic traffic.
