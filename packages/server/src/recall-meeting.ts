/**
 * The bot half of the meeting assistant's lifecycle.
 *
 * `meeting-protocol.ts` is the microphone's: the audio socket IS the meeting,
 * and every way it ends ends the meeting. A bot meeting has no such socket.
 * Its lifecycle is a sequence of vendor STATUS FACTS arriving on a webhook,
 * and its words arrive on a socket the vendor dialled — two channels that can
 * be late, out of order, or (for the webhook) absent entirely. So the rule
 * here is different and stated once:
 *
 *   THE FIRST WORD STARTS THE MEETING; A TERMINAL STATE ENDS IT.
 *
 * Not "the `bot.in_call_recording` webhook starts it". A transcript frame is
 * proof that recording is happening; the webhook is a report that it is. If
 * the report is late, the words would otherwise be dropped on the floor with
 * no meeting to record them into — which is the failure a person would
 * describe as "the bot joined and the notes never came". The webhook still
 * moves the state a person reads, and still ends the meeting, because the
 * absence of words is not evidence of anything.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SHARES WITH THE MICROPHONE PATH, deliberately and completely: the
 * `MeetingStore` record, `beginNotesSession`, the `meeting.started` /
 * `meeting.stopped` broadcasts, and the speaker-name machinery. A bot meeting
 * is not a second kind of meeting — it is the same meeting with a different
 * way of hearing.
