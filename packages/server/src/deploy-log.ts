/**
 * The deploy record: its shape, its durable file, and who gets to say the
 * restart worked.
 *
 * Split out of `deploy.ts` (A7), which decides whether to deploy and then
 * does it. This half is what SURVIVES that — a deploy ends by killing the
 * process that performed it, so everything about the outcome has to be
 * readable from a file afterwards, by a process that did none of the work.
 *
 * Three writers, and they must agree on the record without ever meeting:
 * the deploy stamps `pending` before the restart kills it, the RESTARTED
 * server stamps `healthy`, and a detached watchdog stamps `boot-failed` when
 * the deadline passes with neither having happened. That is why this file is
 * the leaf and holds the shape: `DeployResult` is a wire format between
 * processes, not an internal type of the runner.
 *
 * `VERIFY_BOOT_TIMEOUT_MS` travelled with them — it is the deadline written
 * into the record and the one `bootFailedResult` quotes back — and `deploy.ts`
 * imports it, and the four record types, back under the names it published.
