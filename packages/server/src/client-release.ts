/**
 * Where the browser client prod serves actually lives.
 *
 * It used to be `packages/workspaces-app/dist` inside the primary checkout,
 * read per request. Two things followed from that, both bad:
 *
 *   1. Building the bundles anywhere in that checkout WAS a deploy to every
 *      browser on the fleet — so nobody could build there to test, and the
 *      "don't build in the primary checkout" rule had to live in people's
 *      heads (and in scripts/staging.ts).
 *   2. The served client silently tracked whatever commit that working tree
 *      happened to be sitting on. A checkout parked on a pre-merge commit
 *      served a pre-merge client, with nothing anywhere saying so.
 *
 * So prod copies the built bundles OUT of the checkout into an immutable,
 * numbered release directory under a state root that is not a git working
 * tree, and serves that. The switchover has to be tear-free — there must be
 * no instant where the served directory is half-populated — which is why the
 * publish is two renames and never a copy over live files:
 *
 *   releases/.staging-<id>/   ← the copy lands here, under a dot-name that
 *                               `releases` scanning ignores
 *   rename → releases/<id>/   ← atomic; the release appears complete or not
 *                               at all, and is never written to again
 *   symlink .current-<id> → releases/<id>
 *   rename → current         ← atomic replace of the pointer
 *
 * `current` exists for operators (what is live? roll back to what?). The
 * server is handed the RESOLVED release path, so no in-flight request can
 * resolve half of a path before a swap and half after.
