/**
 * The review quality gate's verdict, in the two shapes the gate answers in.

 * These types live here — beside `review-gate.ts`, which produces them —
 * rather than in the route modules that consume them. They were written
 * inside `routes/task-routes-context.ts` and `routes/docs.ts` because that is
 * where the first reader of each sat, which left `review-gate.ts` importing
 * two types out of `routes/`: a service reaching up into the HTTP layer, and
 * the one import-direction edge the layers exist to forbid.
 *
 * The route contexts re-export their own from here, so a route still reads
 * its vocabulary off the context module it already imports and nothing under
 * `routes/` has to know where the gate keeps its types.
