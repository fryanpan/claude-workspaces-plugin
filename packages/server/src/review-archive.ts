/**
 * The archive manifest: what an archived review WAS, so putting it back is one
 * call rather than an archaeology session.
 *
 * Archiving a review moves its members' `.ydoc` files out of the top level of
 * the data dir, which is the whole mechanism — `hydrateFromDisk` reads only
 * the top level, so the docs stop loading, stop costing a poll, and leave the
 * home page; `activity-backfill` scans `_archive` explicitly, so they keep
 * feeding analysis. But that move also takes the members out of `docStore.list()`,
 * and `docStore.list()` is the ONLY thing that knows which docIds belong to a
 * review (membership lives in each member's own meta). Without a manifest,
 * "unarchive this review" would mean parsing every `.ydoc` in `_archive` to
 * find out — so the writer records the member list, and the operator's reason,
 * on the way out.
 *
 * The manifest deliberately does NOT end in `.ydoc`: the backfill's enumerator
 * filters on that suffix, so a manifest is invisible to analysis rather than a
 * doc that fails to parse.

 * ELSE the round trip needs — which boards to re-attach it to, and who retired
 * it and why — plus the ability to answer "what can I bring back" without
 * parsing every `.ydoc` in `_archive`.
 *
 * The suffix is `.doc.json` rather than `.review.json`, and the difference is
 * load-bearing twice over: neither ends in `.ydoc`, so the backfill's
 * enumerator skips both, and the two listings can enumerate their own kind
 * without a manifest of one kind ever being read as the other.
