/**
 * ONE SSE stream per agent, carrying every key that agent watches.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The MCP child opened one TCP socket per watched key —
 * `/events/<docId>` for each doc and `/workspaces/<id>/events:stream` for
 * each board. A lead session with 214 watches held 214 sockets, and on
 * 2026-09-04 the fleet reached 332 client sockets against this server (plus
 * ~387 server-side ends) and exhausted the kernel's socket memory.
 * `netstat -m` recorded "requests for memory denied"; the supervisor's
 * connect-only bind probe then failed, read the failure as "alive but
 * unbound", and restarted the server —
 * whereupon every client reconnected every key at once on a fixed 1.5s
 * backoff and did it again. Twenty restarts in a day, and a reboot brought
 * the count back inside fifteen minutes because the watch set is persisted.
 *
 * So the fan-out moves to the server. One stream, N channels, each frame
 * tagged with the watch key it arrived on.
 *
 * WHAT IS PRESERVED, DELIBERATELY:
 *
 *  - **Replay is still per key.** The reconnecting client presents a per-key
 *    cursor (see mux-cursor.ts) and each key is answered on its own:
 *    a proven tail, or a `replay.gap` naming THAT key. Collapsing the gap
 *    signal across keys would tell a session to refetch everything because
 *    one channel aged out, or — far worse — let one channel's clean catch-up
 *    vouch for another's hole.
 *  - **`agentId` is registered on board channels only.** A doc stream opened
 *    by the MCP child has always been anonymous, and `agentsOn` / `sendToAgent`
 *    / the lead-presence monitor all read that registration. Naming the agent
 *    on every doc channel would silently widen every delivery decision that
 *    asks "is that agent reachable", which is a different change from this
 *    one. The agent id IS passed to `replayAfter` on every channel, because
 *    filtering a catch-up to what this subscriber may see is not the same
 *    question as who is registered.
 *  - **The old per-key routes keep working.** Nothing here replaces them;
 *    clients on the previous bundle stay live through the rollout.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEW: the channel set is re-read when the agent's watch set changes,
 * so `watch_doc` / `unwatch_doc` reach the stream without a reconnect. That
 * is the property that keeps this from trading a socket storm for a
 * reconnect storm.
