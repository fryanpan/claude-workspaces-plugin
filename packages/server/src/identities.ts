/**
 * The people roster.
 *
 * There is no human roster in this codebase today. `KNOWN_USERS` in
 * `core/identity.ts` is a two-entry hardcoded const, `attachments` is the
 * AGENT roster, `members` means member docs of a review and `participants`
 * means repliers on a thread. So this file creates the list rather than
 * filtering one: a person becomes a row here the first time they prove
 * control of an email address — by answering a code, or by arriving through
 * Cloudflare Access with a verified claim.
 *
 * Shape decisions, each with its reason:
 *
 * - **One JSON file, `identities.json`, rewritten whole through a temp file
 *   and a rename**, the same shape `agent-watches.json` uses and for the same
 *   reasons: the set is tens of rows, and a crash mid-write leaves the
 *   previous file rather than half of one.
 * - **The id is derived, never stored-and-assigned.** `emailIdentityId` in
 *   core is the one derivation (see its docs); this store holds what cannot
 *   be derived — display name, colour, status, and what was merged into it.
 *   That means a lost roster costs preferences, not attribution: the same
 *   address still resolves to the same id on the next login.
 * - **Archiving is the removal**, per the project-wide soft-delete rule. A
 *   row is never dropped, because the ids in it are stamped on comments and
 *   activity rows that must keep rendering a name years later. `archive` sets
 *   a status and a reason; `unarchive` puts it back.
 * - **`mergedFrom` maps legacy actor ids onto this identity.** The merge
 *   itself is a later commit; the field and its resolution live here now so
 *   readers already resolve through it, and so the merge script has somewhere
 *   to write that never rewrites a stored ydoc or activity row.
 * - **Agents are rows too (`kind: 'agent'`).** Until they were, the roster
 *   was one address book for people and a different, per-board one
 *   (`attachments`) for helpers — so a helper's display name was whatever
 *   its launch env said that day, and three spellings of one agent were
 *   three agents. An agent row has no email; its id is the one the MCP mints
 *   (`agentIdForName`), written on attach, and `resolveAgentId` maps every
 *   spelling a task or attachment could hold back onto it.
 * - **Sessions are revocable without touching the cookie.** `sessionsValidFrom`
 *   is a watermark: a session cookie issued before it is refused. That makes
 *   "log me out everywhere" one field write, and it costs no per-session
 *   record to sweep.
 * - **A corrupt file is renamed aside, never overwritten** — the next write
 *   would otherwise destroy the only evidence of what went wrong.
