/**
 * Which builder worktrees are currently working which tasks.
 *
 * The stall loop's clock reads board activity — transitions, edits, comments.
 * A dispatched builder works in a private git worktree the board cannot see,
 * so a task with a busy builder shows the exact silence the loop wakes the
 * lead over: measured 2026-08-28, 8 of 9 stall wakes were this false
 * positive. This registry is the missing witness. The lead registers a
 * dispatch {taskId, worktreePath} when it spawns a builder and closes it on
 * terminal (done or died); in between, a recursive fs.watch on the worktree
 * turns file churn into a lastActivityAt the stall pass can read.
 *
 * Shape decisions, each with its reason:
 *
 * - **One JSON file, `dispatches.json`, in the data dir**, rewritten whole on
 *   change via write-temp-then-rename — the agent-watches.ts pattern, for the
 *   same reasons (a handful of entries; a crash mid-write leaves the previous
 *   file). What persists is the SET of open dispatches, not the activity
 *   clock: activity arrives many times a second while a build runs, and a
 *   registry that flushed per keystroke would be its own load. After a
 *   restart a revived dispatch reads as no-signal until its next event —
 *   honest, and self-correcting within one write.
 * - **Activity is an event, never a poll.** The watcher records a timestamp
 *   when the OS says something changed; nothing walks the tree on a timer.
 *   doc-store.ts avoids fs.watch for BOUND FILES because a file watch pins the
 *   inode an editor's rename-save replaces; a directory watch has no single
 *   inode to go stale on, and this consumer needs none of the file watch's
 *   precision — any event at all is the answer.
 * - **A watcher that fails degrades to no-signal, never crashes.** Arm
 *   failure and runtime error both land in `watching: false` with the
 *   dispatch kept open: the row simply stalls by the ordinary clock, which is
 *   the pre-feature behavior. This is the bound-docs posture (a broken
 *   watcher must not take the doc down) applied here — and it is also the
 *   Linux story, where Bun's recursive directory watch has measurably
 *   dropped events.
 * - **A worktree that no longer exists closes its dispatch on read** — the
 *   builder is gone and `git worktree remove` was its terminal statement.
 *   Prune-on-read rather than a sweeper, matching agent-watches: the readers
 *   (the stall pass, the REST list) are exactly the moments staleness would
 *   mislead. Dispatch records are coordination state, not user content, so
 *   hard-deleting a closed one is not a soft-delete concern.
 * - **A task the board is done with closes its dispatch the same way.** The
 *   registry does not know what a task is; the server hands it `isTaskOver`
 *   (done or archived) and every read — `list`, `activityFor`, and the
 *   boot-time `prune` — treats such a task exactly like a vanished
 *   worktree. Closed IN THE REGISTRY and persisted, never filtered by a
 *   caller: the cap view, the dispatch refusal, the stall gate's watching
 *   set and `/api/dispatches` all read this one set, and a filter in one of
 *   them would let the others keep counting a slot nobody holds. Measured
 *   2026-08-31 right after a deploy: the board read `inUse 12 / free 0`, every
 *   holder a task already `done` whose builder finished on a bundle that
 *   never sent `close_dispatch` — and the first real spawn would have been
 *   refused. Leaving the worktree directory behind (a done builder's checkout
 *   often lingers on disk) is exactly why the path check alone was not enough.
 * - **A corrupt file is renamed aside, never overwritten** — losing the set
 *   is recoverable (the lead re-registers on its next dispatch); destroying
 *   the evidence of what went wrong is not.
