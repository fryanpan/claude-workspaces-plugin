   * board with more than one member that is one person naming another and
   * being served their queue, or moving their marker, which the member
   * boundary otherwise forbids everywhere else.
   *
   * `authorFor` is the server's own verdict and already ranks the proofs: a
   * Cloudflare Access email or a session outranks whatever the body claims,
   * and a share visitor with nothing proven is their own stable guest. So a
   * VERIFIED caller is whoever was verified, full stop.
   *
   * It answers undefined for the caller every other route lets speak for
   * itself — an agent or the owner over loopback, with no session at all —
   * and those fall back to the name the request supplies, exactly as before.
   * That is the same boundary `authorFor` draws for attribution on every
   * write, rather than a second rule about markers.
   *
   * The key is still the display NAME, not the identity id, because that is
   * what the stored markers hold; two verified people whose display names
   * collide share a marker, which is a pre-existing property of the store and
   * not something this line makes worse.
