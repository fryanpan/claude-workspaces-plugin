/**
 * The two routes keyed on an AGENT ID rather than on a doc or a board:
 * the durable watch set, and the merge that folds one agent id into another.
 *
 * One family because both are written in terms of the same identity — the
 * watch set is keyed by agent id, and the merge is the verb that moves it,
 * along with the roster row, the lead seats and the attachment records. A
 * merge that re-keyed the roster without re-keying the watches would leave
 * an agent's deliveries stranded on the old id, so the two live together and
 * the merge's re-key sits beside the list it moves.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim out of `createServer`'s request closure, keeping the chain
 * position it had: after the goal / promote routes, before the builder
 * dispatch block. Dependencies arrive in an explicit context rather than
 * captured from the closure, following `task-routes-context.ts`.
