/**
 * `DELETE /workspaces/<id>` — the board, and ONLY the board.
 *
 * It used to front two stores, dispatching on whether the id named a board and
 * falling through to the review destroy when it did not. That fall-through
 * was compatibility: `delete_workspace(reviewId)` was what every shipped
 * plugin bundle and skill called, from sessions nobody could restart.
 *
 * It is gone with the canonical cutover (owner's call), and the reason is the
 * cutover's own shape rather than tidiness. A review is not a board and never
 * was; it is a resource a board holds, so it is addressed under the board that
 * holds it — `DELETE /workspaces/<ws>/attachments/<setId>`, which the archive
 * family serves and which the scope middleware checks the pair of ids on. One
 * id in the board's slot could only ever mean one of the two things, and the
 * store that happened to know it was what decided which: an id that both
 * stores knew would have been destroyed by whichever was asked first.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS, stated rather than discovered: a session still holding a
 * pre-cutover bundle that calls `delete_workspace(reviewId)` now gets a 404
 * instead of a destroyed review. That is the intended direction of the
 * failure — the whole cutover ships as one version bump with a session
 * restart behind it, and a stale caller failing to delete is the safe half of
 * "no old-path support".
