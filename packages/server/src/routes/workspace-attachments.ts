/**
 * Which agents are attached to a board, their heartbeats, and the receipts that clear their queues.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim out of `createServer`'s request closure; the handlers
 * read their collaborators off `WorkspaceRoutesContext` instead of the scope.
 *
 * The roster lives at `/workspaces/<id>/agents`. It used to be
 * `/workspaces/<id>/attachments`, and that name was the collision the
 * glossary could not land around: an *attachment* is a doc, a mockup, a
 * preview or a diff filed on a board, and this collection holds none of
 * those — it holds the sessions sitting at the board. The plainer noun goes
 * to the thing being displaced, and `attachments` is left free for the
 * collection the glossary spends it on. The old path is gone, not aliased.
 *
 * EVERY SEGMENT HERE IS DECODED WITH `safeDecodeSegment`, never a bare
 * decode. `matchWorkspaceRoute` guards the workspace segment and nothing
 * else, so the agent ids and queue entry ids these four routes read out of
 * the remainder were the unguarded half: a stray `%` threw a `URIError`
 * inside the route match, which closes the connection with no response at
 * all — neither an allow nor a deny, and chosen by whoever sent the request.
 * Same posture as `middleware/host-guard.ts` and `workspace-path.ts` on the
 * same problem.
