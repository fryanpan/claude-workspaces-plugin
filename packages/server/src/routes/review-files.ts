/**
 * A review's own files: its thread roll-up, its grouped-diff sidebar, its
 * file tree, and the two lazy opens that bring one more file into it.
 *
 * One family because every route here addresses a REVIEW by set id — a diff
 * review or a bound folder — and reads or re-reconciles the file collection
 * under it. They were written as one if-chain inside `createServer` and the
 * sequence was kept exactly through the move. Order among them is not
 * load-bearing: each match is a distinct anchored regex plus a method, so no
 * two can claim the same request.
 *
 * The `/api/reviews` ⇄ `/workspaces` alias every one of them matches
 * is the `REVIEW_API` block below, which moved here with them.
 *
 * Dependencies arrive in an explicit context rather than captured from the
 * `createServer` closure, following `task-routes-context.ts`.

/**
 * ===== A review is addressed under the board that holds it. =====
 *
 * These eight used to answer at `/api/reviews/<setId>/…`, and before that at
 * a `/workspaces/<id>/…` alias meaning something else entirely — the review's
 * own id in the board's slot, from when a review WAS called a workspace. Both
 * spellings are gone. What is left is the canonical one:
 * `/workspaces/<workspaceId>/attachments/<setId>/<sub>`, where the first segment
 * is the BOARD the review is filed on and the second is the review.
 *
 * That is the whole of what the cutover buys here. `/api/reviews/<setId>` named
 * a review and left the server to find its board, so "a review on somebody
 * else's board" was not a shape a request could have — and every route below
 * therefore had to be trusted rather than checked. Now the board is in the
 * path, the shape exists, and `middleware/workspace-scope.ts` refuses it once
 * for all eight.
 *
 * Matched against the SCOPE's remainder rather than the pathname, so a route
 * here is unreachable until that middleware has run — see `matchRest`.
 *
 * The bare `DELETE …/attachments/<setId>` is deliberately NOT in here: it is the
 * destroy verb and lives with the archive family, next to the soft-delete it
 * must not be confused with.
