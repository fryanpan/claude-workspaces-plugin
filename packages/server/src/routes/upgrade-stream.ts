/**
 * ── Upgrade and stream: this request wants a connection, not a response ──
 *
 * Six blocks answering one question. Three websocket upgrades — Recall
 * dialling us with a bot's words, a doc's live meeting audio, and `/y/`
 * editing — and three SSE openers — one agent's whole watch set, one
 * workspace's thread events, one doc's. Every one of them ends with a
 * long-lived connection rather than a body, and every one of them has to
 * decide at the handshake what that connection is allowed to do, because
 * there is no second chance: a websocket is authorized ONCE, at its upgrade.
 *
 * That is why the gates are in here rather than left behind. `shareId`,
 * `shareMember` and `readOnly` are stamped onto the socket at the upgrade so
 * the revocation sweeps can find an open connection later and close it —
 * see the comments on the `/audio/` upgrade, which is the one that spends
 * money while it is open. Moving a gate out of this file, or above the
 * upgrade it guards, breaks that.
 *
 * Composed the way A18 was: a factory of long-lived values, with the address
 * and the admitted visitor passed per call. Nothing the handlers read per
 * request is hoisted to factory time — `docStore`, the meeting sessions and the
 * SSE bus are all read through their stores on each call, and
 * `browserProvedNobody` arrives per request because it closes over the
 * request that is being decided.
 *
 * ── The return contract: three outcomes, not two ──
 *
 * A18 could return `Response | null` because every one of its blocks either
 * answered or declined. This run has a third outcome that Bun spells as a
 * hole in the type system: **a successful upgrade returns `undefined` from
 * `fetch`**, because the socket has taken the connection over and there is
 * no response to send. So `Response | undefined | null` would have three
 * meanings across two nullish values, and the obvious `if (answered) return
 * answered;` at the call site would silently treat a live socket as a
 * fall-through and answer the 404.
 *
 * `StreamOutcome` makes that a compile error instead. Null still means "no
 * block here claimed this address", exactly as it did in place; the other
 * two outcomes are named, and `createServer` is the one place that turns
 * `upgraded` into the `undefined` Bun wants. The run itself is unchanged —
 * it still returns a `Response`, or `undefined` for an upgrade, inside the
 * wrapper below.
