/**
 * The vocabulary every `/api/docs/...` route module shares: the context and
 * request shapes all four of them take, and the three body parsers more than
 * one of them calls.
 *
 * It mirrors `task-routes-context.ts`, and for the reason that file gives.
 * `routes/docs.ts` used to hold this, which made the entry-point module its
 * own siblings' dependency: `doc-resource.ts`, `doc-threads-routes.ts` and
 * `doc-edit-routes.ts` are called BY `docs.ts` and imported types back OUT of
 * it, so the docs family was wired the opposite way round from the tasks
 * family next door. Same routes, same order, one home for the shared names.
 *
 * `ThreadReviewGate` is re-exported rather than declared: the gate that
 * produces it is `review-gate.ts`, a service, and a service may not import a
 * type out of `routes/`.
