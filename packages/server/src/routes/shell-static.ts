/**
 * ── Shell and static serving: which page or asset does this address get ──
 *
 * The tail of the router, plus the closure helpers it calls. One subject:
 * given an address and who is asking, hand back an HTML shell, a built
 * asset, a mockup's own file, or a redirect to the address that has one.
 *
 * Everything here is decided AFTER admission, and its only per-request input
 * is the `visitor` the gate resolved, so this went back to the shape A15 and
 * A16 used and A17 could not: a factory of long-lived values, with the
 * visitor passed per call. `request-admission.ts` is the reason that is
 * safe — the visitor reaching this module has already been admitted and
 * scoped, so nothing here re-decides access, and nothing here should.
 *
 * ── Why the helpers and the routes are one file ──
 *
 * They are one decision read at two depths. `isMockupDoc` exists because a
 * mockup sent to the doc shell paints an empty page under a 200, and FOUR
 * route blocks branch on it to avoid exactly that; `addressableWorkspaceFor`
 * exists because a share visitor must be redirected to the workspace they
 * were shared rather than whichever one holds the doc first, and three
 * blocks call it. Split the helpers from the routes and the rules survive
 * only as long as every future block remembers to ask.
 *
 * ── The fall-through contract ──
 *
 * `serveShellRoutes` returns `Response | null`. Null means "no block here
 * claimed this address", which is what the run did inside `route()` when a
 * static file was missing: `if (resp) return resp;` and on to the next
 * block. `createServer` answers a null with the same 404 that used to sit at
 * the bottom of the handler, so the ordering inside the run and the ordering
 * around it are both unchanged.
