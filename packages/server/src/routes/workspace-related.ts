/**
 * `GET /workspaces/:id/related-work` — what on this board already covers
 * a request, before anybody writes a plan for it.
 *
 * The route's whole job is to assemble candidates out of board state and hand
 * them to the scorer in `@claude-workspaces/core/related-work`, which is pure and
 * unit-tested on its own. Nothing is decided here and nothing is written: a
 * caller reads the answer, and a person decides whether the new plan extends
 * what came back, replaces it, or stands on its own.
 *
 * The candidate set is deliberately narrow, because a list nobody can read is
 * the same as no list:
 *
 *   • Every LIVE goal band — not archived, not a reserved band. A goal is
 *     where a plan lands, so a goal that lines up is the most important thing
 *     the caller can be told.
 *
 *   • Docs filed under this board that READ AS A PLAN (title or path), plus
 *     any doc a live goal LINKS regardless of how it reads. The second half
 *     matters more than it looks: the meeting notes a goal came out of are
 *     rarely called a plan, and they are exactly the doc a new plan should
 *     cite rather than duplicate.
 *
 * `?docId=` is the request's own context — the notes or doc the ask came from
 * — and it is the ONLY thing that earns a link bonus. A band that links that
 * doc is marked `linked`, so the goal that owns this conversation surfaces
 * even when its title shares no word with the request. That is the 2026-09-02
 * case literally: the planning pass wrote a goal with no description and no
 * link to the huddle notes, beside work that was already there.
 *
 * The bonus is relative to the request and never absolute, which is a
 * correction a test made. Marking a doc `linked` because SOME goal points at
 * it is a permanent property of the doc, so the huddle notes came back scored
 * 0.35 against "rotate the sending credentials" — a request they have nothing
 * to do with. A relation has to be a relation TO SOMETHING; being linked in
 * general is just being on the board. So a goal's links earn a doc a place in
 * the candidate set, and only a tie to `docId` is paid for.
 *
 * Reading is free — no author, no write — so the route sits behind the same
 * gate as the rest of the board's reads and takes no body.
