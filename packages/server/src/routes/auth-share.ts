/**
 * The sign-in, session and share-link REST block, in the order it is matched.
 *
 * These routes were written as one long if-chain inside `createServer` and
 * the sequence was kept exactly through the move, so the file stays auditable
 * against the pre-split closure. Order is behaviour in two places here, and
 * both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - the browser-write refusal on `/api/share*` sits ABOVE every share route,
 *    so a mint added later is covered by construction rather than by a list;
 *  - `/share/<slug>` redemption sits above the retired `/s/<slug>` reply, and
 *    both sit above the mint routes, so a redemption can never be answered by
 *    a mint's argument validation.
 *
 * The guard against reordering is the per-route HTTP suite —
 * `auth-*.test.ts`, `share-*.test.ts`, `widget-token.test.ts` — each of which
 * fails if its path starts reaching a different handler.
 *
 * Dependencies arrive in an explicit context rather than captured from the
 * `createServer` closure, following `task-routes-context.ts`.
