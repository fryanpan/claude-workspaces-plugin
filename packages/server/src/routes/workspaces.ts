/**
 * The workspace REST block, in the order it is matched.
 *
 * Order is behaviour here, not style. These routes were written as one long
 * if-chain inside `createServer`, and the chain is walked top to bottom, so
 * a route that moves up or down can start answering a path that used to
 * reach a different one. Splitting the chain into files kept the sequence
 * exactly. Nothing in the suite asserts the ORDER on its own — the guard is
 * the per-route HTTP tests (attachments.test.ts, delete-workspace.test.ts,
 * the goal-*.test.ts family and the board-*.test.ts family), each of which
 * fails if its path starts reaching a different handler.
 *
 * FOUR entry points because the block sits in four places, not one. The task
 * routes run between the board's own routes and its goal list; five hundred
 * lines of chat-audit, plugin, push and deploy routes run between the goals
 * and the agent attachments; and the archive routes run between those and
 * the DELETE. Each entry point is called from the position its routes
 * occupied, so nothing overtakes anything.
