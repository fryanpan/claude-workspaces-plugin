/**
 * Archive and unarchive, for a review and for one free-standing doc.
 *
 * SOFT BY DEFAULT is the project rule these routes exist to keep: the `.ydoc`
 * is the durable record the analyses are rebuilt from, so a delete retires a
 * review rather than destroying it and `?purge=true` is how the destructive
 * half is asked for. The four routes and `DELETE /api/reviews/:id` are one
 * family because they share `archiveReview` and the board-relink bookkeeping
 * around it — a row pointing at a review that no longer loads is a dead end,
 * so archiving takes the row and the manifest remembers which boards to put
 * it back on.
 *
 * `deleteReview` is built here and handed back to `createServer`, because
 * `DELETE /workspaces/:id` (routes/workspace-delete.ts) fronts both verbs
 * and still calls it from further down the chain.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim out of `createServer`'s request closure, keeping its chain
 * position: after the agent attachments, before the board delete.
 * Dependencies arrive in an explicit context, following
 * `task-routes-context.ts`.
