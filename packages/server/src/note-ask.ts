/**
 * Does a task note say the agent is WAITING ON A PERSON?
 *
 * The keep-moving protocol's first rule is that no ask to a person exists
 * only in prose: it is a review item on their queue or it is nothing. The
 * stall loop enforced that for rows the board could SEE were waiting — an
 * owner-kind of `person`, a row under the owner's own band — and for nothing
 * else. An agent-owned row whose end-of-turn note said "Waiting on Bryan: the
 * four factual corrections sit in the doc…" read as an ordinary in-progress
 * row, and its note reset the very clock that would have named it. Three rows
 * waited hours that way (2026-09-04) while the lead was told only that they
 * were quiet, which it had already been told.
 *
 * So the note itself is read. Two stages, in this order:
 *
 *  1. **A deterministic prefilter** — `noteReadsAsWaitingOnPerson` below. It
 *     costs nothing, it runs on every tick, and it is what decides when there
 *     is no judge configured.
 *  2. **A Haiku confirmation of a prefilter HIT**, cached per note, run in the
 *     background by `NoteAskClassifier`. It can only ever say "no, that was
 *     not an ask" — a prefilter miss is never sent anywhere, so the judge
 *     narrows the finding and never widens it.
 *
 * The failure policy is the review gate's, for the same reason
 * (`decisions.md`, 2026-08-29): no key, an error, a timeout or an unparseable
 * reply leaves the PREFILTER'S verdict standing. This is a nudge toward
 * filing the ask, never a door that closes when the API does.
 *
 * **The known bias, stated rather than hidden:** the release vocabulary wins
 * over the waiting vocabulary, so a note that is still waiting while it
 * mentions an answer ("Waiting on Bryan — I answered his question") reads as
 * released and is never sent to the judge. That direction is deliberate. A
 * false wake costs a lead session's whole turn (~800k tokens, see
 * docs/architecture/stall-detection.md), and a missed one still reaches the
 * lead through the ordinary stall clock a window later.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches the network. The Haiku half is `note-ask-judge.ts`,
 * the same split as `review-judge-prompt.ts` / `review-judge.ts`.

/**
 * Phrases where the writer has stopped and something else has to move. Each

 * than from the first draft. "Any waiting phrase anywhere AND any person word
 * anywhere" reads "Blocked on the CI runner outage; the vendor says their fix
 * is rolling out." as an ask, on the strength of a possessive eight words
 * away. With no key configured — a supported state — that row would flip out
 * of `in-progress`, off the stalled list, out of reach of `builder-silent`,
 * and wake the lead to file an ask that does not exist. Waiting on a machine
 * has to stay ordinary work, and the only thing separating it from waiting on
 * a person is what the phrase is waiting FOR.
