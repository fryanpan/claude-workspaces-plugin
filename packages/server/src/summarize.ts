/**
 * Generated thread summaries: the half that talks to the network.
 *
 * The prompt, the parsing and the "is this worth a call" rule live in
 * `@claude-workspaces/core/summary-prompt` and are pure. This file owns everything that
 * is not: the API key, the HTTP call, the debounce, and the promise that stops
 * three browsers on one doc from paying for the same summary three times.
 *
 * THIS IS THE SERVER'S ONLY OUTBOUND API ACCESS. Two consequences worth
 * keeping in mind when editing it:
 *
 *  - Comment text AND the anchored source line leave the machine — on a diff
 *    or code doc the anchor snippet is the code itself, not just prose.
 *    Approved 2026-08-10 for this purpose and no other. The account the key
 *    belongs to is a privacy boundary that nothing here enforces — see the
 *    design spec's note before widening what gets sent. Because of that, the
 *    key must be a DEDICATED one the operator chose to add: a generic
 *    `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` sitting in the launch environment is not consent,
 *    and is deliberately not honoured (see `resolveKey`).
 *  - Every failure is non-fatal. An absent key, an offline machine, a 429, a
 *    reply that will not parse: all of them leave the deterministic card lines
 *    exactly where they were. Generation is an enhancement to a working card,
 *    never a dependency of one.
