 * it the lookups (doc meta, board membership, task, workspace) and this
 * module owns which URL shape asks which one. Unresolvable is ALWAYS `null`,
 * never a throw — the client's contract is "null means show the raw URL".
 *
 * A board-scoped address must be TRUTHFUL to resolve: a URL only yields a

 * Otherwise a valid id pasted under the wrong board would leak the title of a
 * resource the address lies about. Every shape names a workspace, so this
 * holds for all of them.
