/**
 * What a session RECORDS about a row without changing it: the pinned
 * one-liner, the effort estimate a scoring run produced, the done-artifact
 * verdict, and reading time.
 *
 * Split out of `tasks.ts` with the other four verb families. The family is
 * defined by what it does NOT do rather than by the shape of its records:
 * with the single exception of
 * `appendNote` — which emits `task.noted` so the board re-projects and the
 * actor's work clock moves — nothing here emits a store event and nothing
 * here bumps `updatedAt`. That is deliberate and it is the same reason four
 * times over: an observation ABOUT a ticket must not read as progress ON it,
 * or attention and machine bookkeeping would keep resetting the staleness
 * clock and the ready-nudger's idle clock. Keeping them together is what
 * makes that rule one reading instead of four comments.

  /**
   * Record one scoring run's read on a ticket — a produced estimate or a
   * recorded failure. Quiet like `recordReadingTime`: no store event, no
   * `updatedAt` bump, and for the same class of reason — a score is
   * metadata ABOUT the ticket, not an edit OF it — plus one that reading
   * time does not have: scoring itself is triggered off `task.created` /
   * `task.retitled` / `task.body_edited` (server.ts), so a write here that
   * emitted one of those would re-trigger its own scorer forever.
   *
   * Refused as `stale` when the words (or the goal) this run read are no
   * longer the ticket's current words: `estimate.forWordsRevision` must
   * still equal the row's `wordsRevision`. Guards against a slow call
   * landing after a NEWER edit — or a re-triage to a different goal, which
   * changes the goal title the scorer weighed — already started (or
   * finished) its own re-score: that newer run's answer must stand, not be
   * overwritten by a late answer to older words or an old goal.
   *
   * ONE token, and a monotonic one. This used to compare the three
   * timestamps the estimate still carries — `forTitleWrittenAt` /
   * `forBodyWrittenAt` / `forGoal` against `titleWrittenAt` /
   * `bodyWrittenAt` / `goal` — and a millisecond is not fine enough to
   * separate a create from the rename that follows it: land both in one
   * tick and the older run's captured token still equals the row's current
   * one, the guard reads "not stale", and the stale answer wins. See
   * `forWordsRevision`. The timestamps are kept on the record as
   * provenance a person reads; they are no longer asked a question they
   * cannot answer.
   *
   * A record that somehow carries no revision at all compares `undefined`
   * against a number and is REFUSED, which is the safe direction: an
   * estimate whose provenance cannot be established must not overwrite one
   * whose provenance can.
