/**
 * The review-item quality gate's network half: ask Haiku whether an item
 * meets the workspace's criteria.
 *
 * The prompt and the parser are pure and live in
 * `@claude-workspaces/core/review-judge-prompt`; this file owns the key, the HTTP call
 * and the timeout — the same split, and the same rules, as `summarize.ts`:
 *
 *  - **The key is the dedicated summary key**, read through `resolveKeyFrom`
 *    with the same Keychain services and the same `CW_SUMMARY_API_KEY`
 *    override. The consent that key represents (2026-08-10) covers comment
 *    text leaving the machine for a card; a review item's headline, detail
 *    and options are the same class of workspace content going to the same
 *    endpoint, so no second key and no second act of consent are asked for.
 *    A generic `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is deliberately not honoured, for the
 *    reason `summarize.ts` gives at length.
 *  - **Every failure is a pass.** No key, a timeout, a non-2xx, a reply that
 *    will not parse — all return `null`, and the caller records the item as
 *    judged `unavailable` and lets it through. Bryan's rule (2026-08-29):
 *    don't refuse; never block on the judge being down. Logged ONCE per
 *    process per cause, so an outage costs a line and not a log.
 *  - **One call per create or revise, no retries.** The item is on the
 *    ticket either way; a second call would spend money to delay a verdict
 *    the filer can trigger again by revising.
 *
 * `createServer` takes the judge as an option with NO default — the seam rule
 * the summarizer set: nothing that merely spins a server up (every test,
 * every embedded use) can reach the network. `bin.ts` constructs the real one.
