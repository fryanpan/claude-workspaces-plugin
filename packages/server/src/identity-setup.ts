/**
 * Email-keyed identity: the roster, the sign-in stores, and the four
 * predicates that answer "who is this request".
 *
 * One module because they are one chain. A session cookie names a session,
 * a widget token names the same session, and every liveness rule the cookie
 * faces — the failed-closed denylist, the per-session revocations a logout
 * writes, roster status, the `sessionsValidFrom` watermark — has to apply to
 * the token on every use as well. `sessionIdentityFor` and
 * `widgetTokenIdentityFor` are written to read the same, deliberately, so an
 * edit to one is obviously a change to both; splitting them would be the
 * drift that lets a revoked session keep commenting through its token.
 *
 * The roster is built here whether or not `CW_REQUIRE_EMAIL_AUTH` is set:
 * the flag governs what a session MEANS, not whether a person can create
 * one. The four sign-in switches are resolved here for the same reason —
 * they are read as one set and defaulted against each other.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim out of `createServer`.
