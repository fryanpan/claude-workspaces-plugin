/**
 * The seam a meeting's words arrive through, and the deterministic engine the
 * tests speak to.
 *
 * WHY THE ENGINE IS A PARAMETER AND NEVER A DEFAULT. A streaming speech model
 * is a paid service on a socket that stays open for the length of a meeting.
 * The same seam rule the summarizer earned the hard way applies here with a
 * larger bill attached: `createServer` must be constructible without anything
 * that can reach the network, or every server a test spins up starts opening
 * billed sessions. Only `bin.ts` builds a real engine.
 *
 * WHY A TURN IS THE UNIT. Every streaming model of this shape emits the WHOLE
 * turn as currently understood rather than a delta, and revises it in place
 * until it settles — that is how a mis-heard word gets corrected after it is
 * already on screen. The seam preserves that shape instead of flattening it
 * to appended text, because flattening it is unrecoverable: once "sink" has
 * been concatenated onto the transcript, nothing downstream can turn it back
 * into "sync".
