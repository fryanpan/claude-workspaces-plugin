/**
 * The other half of the composition root: the ONE place a real adapter is

 *
 * Every seam in here follows the same rule, and it is a load-bearing one.
 * `createServer` defaults each of these to a no-op or a null, so nothing that
 * merely spins a server up — every test in packages/server/test, every
 * embedded use — can reach the network, the Keychain, a metered transcription
 * session, this machine's plugin cache, or the launchd service. A real one
 * exists only because this file, reached only from `bin.ts`, built it.
 *
 * The log lines travel with their constructors on purpose: each says which
 * adapter was built and, when one was not, the single command that would
 * change that. Read together they are the boot's account of what this
 * deployment can actually do.
