 * store arrives through `TaskEventBusPersistence`, the same seam
 * `WorkspaceStore` / `GoalStore` / `AgentStore` already use, so no caller of
 * `TaskStore.onEvent` or of the store's own verb methods has to learn that
 * emit now crosses a file boundary.
 *
 * `emit`'s own order is the contract callers rely on and is preserved
 * exactly: audit append FIRST (§3.6 — "an event was emitted" and "the audit
 * log has it" must be the same fact by construction), then the
 * observed-work note, then the listener fan-out.
