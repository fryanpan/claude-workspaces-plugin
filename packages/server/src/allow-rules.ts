/**
 * Allow-rule proposals — turning a denial the classifier keeps repeating
 * into ONE question Bryan can answer from his phone.
 *
 * The plugin's PermissionDenied hook posts a `denial` note carrying only the
 * command's SHAPE (`git push`, `rm -rf`, or a tool name); the pane shows each
 * one. What the pane cannot do is stop the loop: auto mode re-asks after
 * every chat approval, so the third `git push` block in a week is the same
 * block as the first. This module notices the repeat and files a `decision`
 * review item on the task the note landed on, carrying a paste-ready
 * `permissions.allow` rule for the person to apply themselves.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does NOT do:
 *  - **Write settings.** No code path here — or anywhere the server owns —
 *    opens a `settings.json`. The rule is text in the item's detail; pasting
 *    it is the person's act, and an agent asked to do it says no. That is
 *    what keeps "truly dangerous commands still stop" true: the only hand on
 *    the allowlist is a human one.
 *  - **Count from the notes.** Neither copy of a denial note is a reliable
 *    tally. The per-agent ring is in-process, capped at 20 notes of every
 *    kind, and gone on restart — three denials a day apart never meet in
 *    it. The task notes are durable but capped at 200 per row from the old
 *    end, and a busy row posts a turn note every turn, so a week's denials
 *    on a chatty task can be evicted before the third arrives (codex review,
 *    2026-08-29). So the tally lives here: one small sidecar beside the
 *    workspace files, keyed `(agent, shape)`, holding the denial timestamps
 *    inside the window and which item was last filed. The notes stay the
 *    pane's record; this is the counter.
 *
 * Whether the filed item is still open, or was answered "Never propose
 * again", is read from the review item itself — the one record a person
 * actually touched — not from a second flag free to disagree with it. A
 * `never` answer is honoured for as long as the item exists.
