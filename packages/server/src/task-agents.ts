/**
 * Agents on a board: who is attached, how recently the server saw them, and
 * the lead seat's health.
 *
 * Split out of `tasks.ts` — the second of the store's four responsibilities.
 * Nothing here reads or writes a task row: attachments live in their own
 * sidecar, and what this file needs from the store arrives through
 * `AgentStorePersistence` rather than a `this` that reaches all of it.
 *
 * The two delivery queues that hold work for an agent that is not live right
 * now — voice change-requests and comments — were split further, into
 * `agent-voice-queue.ts` and `agent-comment-queue.ts`: each was already a
 * banner in this file (`// ── Voice`, `// ── Comment queue`), one store each,
 * reachable only through this same `AgentStorePersistence` seam. `AgentStore`
 * composes one instance of each and its own methods delegate to them, so its
 * public API is unchanged.
 *
 * The attachment constants and the derived-state helpers live here rather
 * than in `tasks.ts` for the same reason `isRetired` lives in
 * `workspace-store.ts`: this file may not import a VALUE from the file that
 * imports it. `tasks.ts` imports them back and re-exports them, so no caller
 * outside either file changes.

   * and stays live. Only once the stream is gone does the clock get a vote,
   * and then at `LEAD_SEAT_STALE_MS` rather than the delivery gate's window.
   *
   * It is deliberately NOT keyed on how long the board has been quiet.
   * Elapsed silence was measured at 40% false positives against provably
   * active sessions, and it cannot tell a busy lead from an exited one —
   * which is the single distinction this whole read exists to make.
   *
   * A seat held by an id that never attached (`known-agent`, a hand-set
   * lead) is stale too, and with no `lastObservedAt`: nothing was ever
   * observed, so there is no moment to report and no reason to believe
