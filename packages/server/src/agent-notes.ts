/**
 * Agent notes — the one-liners the plugin's Stop and PermissionDenied hooks
 * post so a per-agent activity pane can say what each agent did lately.
 *
 * Three pieces, all small:
 *  - `parseAgentNote`: the wire shape `POST /api/agent-notes` accepts, and
 *    the 400s it refuses. The server stores the text VERBATIM — reducing a
 *    closing message to one safe line is the hook's job, and a server that
 *    quietly filtered would hide from the hook's author that it had to.
 *  - `resolveNoteTarget`: which row an agent is working RIGHT NOW. There is
 *    no register of that: the dispatch registry keys on task, heartbeats key
 *    on agent, and neither names the other. The answer the board already
 *    gives (`claimSessionReader`) is the row's latest `in-progress` claim,
 *    so this reads the same evidence — an in-progress row the agent owns or
 *    last claimed — across every workspace. It answers with a row only when
 *    the agent holds exactly ONE: a 2-week replay of prod notes (2026-08-31)
 *    found 93% of automatic notes faced 2+ held rows, and a judged sample
 *    put the old newest-claim guess wrong ~3 times in 4 — a lead session
 *    claims rows for the builders it dispatches, so its end-of-turn digest
 *    was landing on whichever row happened to be claimed last. Ambiguity now
 *    goes to the ring marked `needsFiling` instead of onto a coin-flip row.
 *  - `AgentNoteRing`: the per-agent memory, in-process and bounded. A note
 *    with no current task has nowhere durable to go, but the pane still
 *    wants to show it; a bound note is recorded here too, tagged with its
 *    task, so the pane has ONE read per agent instead of a join. Lost on
 *    restart by design — the task-bound copy is the record.
