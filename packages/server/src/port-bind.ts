/**
 * Bind policy: what a failed listen() MEANS, and what to do about it.
 *
 * Written after the 2026-08-29 outage, whose whole shape came from one
 * conflation. `scripts/serve.ts` probed a port with a throwaway
 * `net.createServer().listen()` and resolved `false` on ANY `error` event, so
 * "someone else owns this port" and "this host cannot open a socket right
 * now" were the same answer. When the machine ran out of network buffers,
 * every one of the 50 probed ports "failed", the supervisor threw `no free
 * port near 8787`, and launchd relaunched it every 10s — 393 times, each
 * relaunch re-running two client builds and re-hydrating 5,622 documents.
 *
 * The three exported pieces are the policy, kept pure so they can be tested
 * without sockets, clocks, or a spare port:
 *
 *   classifyBindError  — in-use vs. host-unavailable vs. a real bug
 *   bindRetryDelayMs   — the backoff schedule
 *   shouldWalkPorts    — whether moving to the next port is even legal
 *
 * `acquirePort` composes them against injected probe/sleep functions.
 */
/**
 * - `in-use`: another process holds the port. Waiting can fix it; so can
 *   walking to the next port, WHERE WALKING IS ALLOWED.
 * - `unavailable`: the host cannot give us a socket at all (out of buffers,
 *   out of descriptors, the address is gone). The port is not the problem, so
 *   walking to a different one is guaranteed not to help and actively hurts —
 *   it is how a supervisor ends up believing 50 ports are occupied. Wait.
 * - `fatal`: anything we do not recognise. Do not paper over it with a retry
 *   loop; let it throw so it gets read.

// The OTHER probe: is the server still LISTENING?
//
// `acquirePort` above asks whether this process can take a port. The
// supervisor's bind-health watchdog asks the opposite question of a port it
// already gave away — and until 2026-09-04 it made exactly the conflation
// this file was written to end, one layer down. `isPortListening` resolved
// `false` on ANY connect error, so "nothing is listening there" and "this host
// cannot open a socket right now" were the same answer.
//
// That is what turned a socket-memory exhaustion into an outage. The fleet's
// SSE connections used up the kernel's socket buffers (`netstat -m`:
// "requests for memory denied"), the watchdog's own connect then failed for
// want of a socket, and it read a perfectly healthy bound server as unbound
// and restarted it — twenty times, each restart triggering a fleet-wide
// reconnect that made the shortage worse.
//
// So a connect failure has two answers, not one. The probe itself, and what
// a verdict does to the watchdog, live in `supervisor-health.ts`.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * What a failed connect() means.

 * - `inconclusive`: this host could not give the probe a socket at all. That
 *   is evidence about the machine and none whatsoever about the server, so it
 *   must not count toward a restart.
 *
 * An UNRECOGNISED code counts as `not-listening`, deliberately. Every error
 * counted before this change, so treating the unknown as inconclusive would
 * quietly disable the watchdog for whatever failure mode nobody has named
 * yet — and the watchdog exists because an alive-but-unbound server is
 * invisible to launchd. The named host-resource codes are the exception, and
 * they are the same list `classifyBindError` uses because they are the same
 * failure.
