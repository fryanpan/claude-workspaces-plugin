/**
 * Backfill the hands-on activity stream from persisted .ydoc files.
 *
 * Scans every .ydoc in `<dataDir>` AND `<dataDir>/_archive`, reads each doc's
 * threads (every comment carries a ts + author), and emits comment / reply /
 * resolve / reopen events using the SAME deterministic eventId scheme as live
 * capture — so a re-run dedupes (identical ids) and never double-counts.
 *
 * Scope:
 *   - Only comment-family events backfill. read_session / doc_open were never
 *     recorded historically (scroll wasn't tracked), so they're not
 *     backfillable — they're complete only from this feature's go-live.
 *   - The first comment of a thread → `comment`; each subsequent comment →
 *     `reply`. A currently-resolved thread emits one `resolve` event at the
 *     thread's last-activity time. (reopen history isn't recoverable from a
 *     CRDT snapshot, which only holds current state — noted in the report.)
 *   - Reaches back to WR's clean-data window (~2026-04-17). Older events are
 *     skipped by default.
 *
 * Never deletes or modifies .ydoc files — read-only over the snapshots.
