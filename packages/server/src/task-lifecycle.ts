   * audit trail.
   *
   * Gate semantics, in order:
   *  - unknown task / unknown status / no-op same-status → validation errors.
   *  - a GOAL row holds `triage` on the same terms a task does, and this gate
   *    is the only door into it. It used to be refused here
   *    (`goal-not-triageable`) on the reasoning that triage is a claim about a
   *    TASK and a goal is "neither filed by an agent nor dispatched". The
   *    second half was wrong: a band is dispatched transitively, because every
   *    task in it inherits its priority — so an un-agreed band hands its rows
   *    to a dispatcher on the strength of an agreement nobody made. Triage on
   *    a goal closes that one level up, and `buildQueue` is where it bites.
   *  - moving FORWARD (to in-progress or done) consults `after`: open
   *    dependencies come back as `blockers` in the result; an edge marked
   *    enforce refuses outright. Moving back to todo never consults the gate
   *    (undoing work must not be blockable).
   *  - moving OUT of triage is not a special case and gets no special verb:
   *    it is an ordinary move, attributed like any other, and the trail entry
   *    the gate already writes (`from: 'triage'`, plus who and when) IS the
   *    record that somebody vetted the row. `to: 'todo'` is a backward move
   *    and therefore unblockable; `to: 'in-progress'` is forward and consults
   *    `after` like any other forward move, which is correct — starting work
   *    a dependency holds back is the thing that gate exists to stop.
   *  - there is no longer a risk arm. `riskTier` gated an agent's forward
   *    move (red refused, yellow needed `confirmed: true`) until 2026-08-18;
   *    the reasoning for removing it, and what is deliberately still accepted
