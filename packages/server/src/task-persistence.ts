/**
 * The store's disk layer: where each per-workspace sidecar lives, reading
 * and writing the two that hold live state (`<id>.tasks.json`,
 * `<id>.attachments.json`), and the four small "seen through a contract"
 * objects that wire `ReviewItemStore` / `GoalStore` / `AgentStore` /
 * `WorkspaceStore` to the fields those sidecars back.
 *
 * Split out of `tasks.ts` — persist/hydrate and the wiring around them were
 * a layer below the store's own verbs, not a fifth responsibility beside
 * them. Every function here takes an explicit `store` parameter typed to
 * exactly what it reads or writes, the same seam `WorkspaceStore` / `GoalStore`
 * / `AgentStore` already use, so `TaskStore`'s own methods — themselves now
 * thin forwarders onto these functions — keep their signatures and no
 * caller outside this file and `tasks.ts` has to change.
 *
 * `TaskPersistenceHost` is the union of what every function below needs;
 * `TaskStore` satisfies it structurally once the fields and methods below
 * are no longer `private`. It is intentionally one interface rather than
 * one per function — every member is still named for the function(s) that
 * read it, and the alternative (four or five overlapping interfaces) would
 * have `TaskStore` implementing near-duplicates of the same shape.
