/**
 * The browser half of Sentry: what every served shell has to carry so that a
 * page load shows up as a trace, tagged with WHICH KIND of page it was.
 *
 * ## Why a page type at all
 *
 * Asked on 2026-08-29: "I want to understand the load time for each page
 * (home page, doc, mockup, board) and see if there are issues sometimes."
 * Only the board could answer. There was exactly one browser Sentry init, in
 * `board-app.ts`, reading a meta tag only `renderBoardShell` emitted — so every
 * transaction Sentry held was a `/workspaces/...` path and every other
 * surface was silent. "Docs load fine" was not a finding anyone had made; it
 * was a question nobody could ask.
 *
 * Instrumenting the other three shells is only half of it. Their URLs carry
 * ids, so grouping by URL would neither compare across kinds nor be safe to
 * send — see `routePatternForSpan` and the scrub floor in
 * `@claude-workspaces/core/trace-privacy`. The `page_type` tag is what makes the
 * comparison a GROUP BY rather than a path-prefix guess: four values, one
 * median and p95 each, side by side.
 *
 * ## Why a separate script rather than an import in each app
 *
 * `/app/sentry.js` is its own build entry, loaded by a `<script type=
 * "module">` that a shell emits ONLY when a DSN is configured. Three reasons
 * it is not an `import()` inside app.js / board.js / the widget:
 *
 * - `app.ts` and the widget build with `splitting: false`, so a dynamic
 *   `import('@sentry/browser')` inside either is INLINED into the entry —
 *   the SDK would ship in the bundle every doc load and every mockup fetches,
 *   configured or not. The widget bundle size is a hard project constraint.
 * - A page with no DSN then has no script tag at all, which is a stronger
 *   version of the "no DSN, no SDK, no outbound request" contract than a
 *   runtime `if`: there is nothing to fetch and nothing to run.
 * - The mockup surface is somebody else's HTML with the widget injected into
 *   it. It has no bundle of ours to put an import inside.
 *
 * The DSN itself is box config (`CW_SENTRY_DSN`), never the repo.
