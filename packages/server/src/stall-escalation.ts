/**
 * What happens when the lead is told and nothing moves.
 *
 * `stall-nudge.ts` ends at the lead: it names the stuck rows, wakes the
 * session responsible for the board, and stops. That was the documented
 * open gap — nothing escalates past the lead — and it is the gap a board
 * falls into when the lead itself is the thing that has stopped. A session
 * that has died, run out of quota, or is sitting on a question it never
 * filed cannot act on a wake, and every later wake is addressed to the same
 * silence. Measured on the boards this shipped against: rows that sat for
 * hours with their lead woken repeatedly and no human ever told.
 *
 * So this module is the second addressee. When a row the lead was ALREADY
 * TOLD ABOUT is still a finding an hour later, the server files ONE review
 * item, on the board, naming every such row with a link to it. It is written
 * as the server, not as any agent — no session decided this, the board did —
 * and it goes on the reader's Home queue through the same door the allow-rule
 * proposals use (`allow-rules.ts`): `addReviewItem` on the store, which is
 * what puts it in `task-review` without passing the quality judge that guards
 * the ROUTE. Exempt on purpose: the judge exists to make an agent's ask
 * readable, and an item whose words are generated from board state has no
 * author to send it back to.
 *
 * ── One item, updated, never a second one ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The item is per BOARD, not per row. A queue that grows an entry per stuck
 * row is the wake's own failure mode wearing a different hat: five entries
 * saying the same thing train the reader to skim all five. So the set of
 * rows lives in one item's body, revised in place as rows join and leave,
 * withdrawn when none is left, and filed afresh only when the board stalls
 * again after that.
 *
 * ── Why the anchor row is chosen the way it is ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A review item has to hang on a ticket — that is the only surface the Home
 * queue reads — and hanging it on a row CHANGES that row: `keep-moving.ts`
 * reads an open review item as `blocked-on-owner`, which is a row waiting on
 * a person with the ask filed, and such a row is not a stall finding. The
 * anchor therefore goes quiet in the stall pass for as long as this item is
 * open.
 *
 * That is correct for the row this prefers — the worst `unfiled` row, whose
 * whole finding was that nobody had filed the ask. This IS the filed ask; the
 * loop closing is what the bucket change records. It is a real loss of
 * visibility for a stalled row, so a stalled row is only ever the anchor when
 * no unfiled row qualifies, and the item names it either way.
 *
 * It also means the anchor cannot be re-judged by the gate while the item
 * lives, so this module tracks it directly instead: the anchor stops counting
 * when its ticket closes or when anything touches it after our own last write
 * (`anchorHolds`). Without that test the module reacts to the silence it
 * caused — file, watch the anchor leave the findings, withdraw, watch it come
 * back, file again — which is a review item blinking on and off the reader's
 * queue every quiet window. The re-file cooldown below is the second half of
 * the same guard.
 *
 * When the anchor stops holding, the item MOVES: it is withdrawn and re-filed
 * on the worst row that still qualifies, in the same tick and with no
 * cooldown. Two things make that the behaviour rather than revising in place.
 * A `done` ticket's review items are skipped by `taskReviewItems` in
 * `review-queue.ts`, so an item left on one is invisible to the reader while
 * `isReviewItemOpen` still says it is open — every other stuck row on the
 * board would then go unreported behind an ask nobody can see. And the
 * withdrawal is what UNMASKS the old anchor, so a row that was the anchor and
 * is still stuck comes back into a later item under its own name instead of
 * being hidden for as long as the item lives.
 *
 * The residual trade-off, stated because it is real: while an item is open,
 * its anchor is invisible to the stall wake. The lead is not woken about that
 * one row, and the reader's item is the only thing naming it. That is
 * acceptable because the item names it, sits on a queue somebody reads, and
 * the anchor moves the moment its ticket closes or anybody touches it. There
 * is no home for a board-level item that is not a ticket — the allow-rule
 * proposals hang on a ticket too — so the only alternative was to anchor on a
 * row that is NOT stuck, which would tell the reader something false about a
 * healthy row.

 * It exists because the retraction test is far cheaper to trip than the

 * needed one write — and the commonest write on any live board is the row's
