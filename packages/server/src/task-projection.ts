/**
 * Ydoc projection of the board task store (plan §3.3).
 *
 * The sidecar-backed TaskStore is the source of truth for everything the
 * system is accountable for; the `ws:<workspaceId>` doc's `tasks` and
 * `workspace` Y.Maps are a PROJECTION of it so the board renders in
 * realtime. Two rules make "only the server writes" true rather than
 * aspirational (§3.3, ultrareview):
 *
 *  - The server observes both maps and REVERTS any transaction whose Yjs
 *    origin is not its own (`PROJECTION_ORIGIN`). A client write — buggy or
 *    malicious — is reasserted away, and NO task.* event fires for it:
 *    events originate exclusively from store mutations, never from map
 *    observation.
 *  - On hydrate the sidecar is authoritative: the ws doc's .ydoc persists
 *    like any live doc, and `init()` reasserts the projection from the
 *    store after load, so a crash can't leave forged or stale board state
 *    standing.
 *
 * Task BODIES are EDITED in a deliberate exception to "tasks live in the
 * store": each body is a live collaborative doc in its own `task:<taskId>`
 * doc (no file binding), which is what makes every existing edit tool,
 * thread store, REST route, and SSE event apply unchanged (they're all
 * keyed by docId). The store's `body` string is a debounced SNAPSHOT of
 * that doc — a snapshot never re-seeds a live fragment, so fragment
 * identity (and every thread anchor in it) survives projection refreshes
 * and restarts.
 *
 * That snapshot IS projected (capped, see BODY_PROJECTION_LIMIT). It was
 * not, originally, and the cost was that a task read as a bare title and
 * "what is this for" meant navigating to a second page — the
 * store-has-it/surface-can't-show-it failure this codebase has hit before.
 * Note what this widens: the ws doc syncs to workspace-share visitors, and
 * Yjs is a state exchange with no per-connection projection, so a
 * description is now readable by anyone holding a workspace share.
 *
 * What the ws doc syncs is otherwise the §3.3 visitor-contract list:
 * titles, status, order, transitions with actor DISPLAY names (no ids),
 * token usage, goal text, and verbatim quote/answer
 * fields. AgentAttachment records never enter any ydoc.
