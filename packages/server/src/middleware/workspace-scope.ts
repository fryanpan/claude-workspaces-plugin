/**
 * The one place a canonical `/workspaces/<id>/…` request learns which board
 * it is on, and whether that board will have it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The route inventory's shape is the Google API design
 * guide's: a resource a workspace owns is addressed under the workspace that
 * owns it. The point of putting the id in the PATH is not tidiness — it is
 * that the access question can then be answered ONCE, before any handler
 * runs, by something that reads paths. Every route that resolved its own
 * board (`taskStore.getWorkspace(...)` at the top of a handler, or a store
 * lookup that asked which board holds this row) was a second copy of that
 * rule, and a second copy is a rule that drifts.
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERS, and what it deliberately does not. It answers two
 * questions:
 *
 *   1. Does the board named in the path exist?
 *   2. Does the resource named under it actually belong to that board?
 *
 * It does NOT answer whether this caller may reach the board. That question
 * already has one owner — `shareScopeAllows` in `middleware/host-guard.ts`,
 * which runs above every route in the chain and judges the path by the share
 * the visitor holds. Answering it a second time here would be the exact
 * duplication this file exists to remove, and the copy that drifts open is a
 * breach. So membership is enforced upstream by host-guard; what this adds is
 * the half host-guard cannot see, which is whether the ids in the path agree
 * with each other.
 *
 * Question 2 is the one that used to have no owner at all. `/api/goals/<id>`
 * and `/api/docs/<id>` named a member and left the server to find its board,
 * so "a doc on somebody else's board" was not a shape a request could even
 * have. Now that the board is in the path, `/workspaces/<A>/docs/<doc-on-B>`
 * IS a shape a request can have, and it has to be refused in one place rather
 * than in each handler that remembers to.
 *
 * HOW A ROUTE INHERITS THE ANSWER. The scope this returns travels on every
 * resource route's request, and those routes match against `scope.rest`
 * through `matchRest` rather than against the raw pathname. So a handler
 * reached without a resolved scope has no remainder to match and cannot
 * answer at all: "the workspace was checked" is not a step each route
 * remembers, it is the condition of the route existing. That is the half of
 * criterion 2 a deletion of the old per-handler checks does not by itself
 * buy — deleting them stops the second copy, and this stops the third from
 * being written.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES WITH. 404, not 403, and the same body for a board that does
 * not exist and a row filed elsewhere. A 403 on a foreign id confirms the id
 * is real to someone who guessed it; the two answers are deliberately
 * indistinguishable.
 *
 * HTML PAGES ARE NOT ITS BUSINESS. `/workspaces/<id>` and its tabs, and
 * `docs|mockups|attachments/<id>`, are browser addresses served at the tail of the
 * chain by `routes/shell-static.ts`, which renders its own HTML not-found for
 * an unknown board. Claiming those here would answer a browser with a JSON
 * body. `isBoardPageRequest` is the single list both sides read — see
 * `workspace-path.ts` for why it is one list and not two.
 *
 * NEITHER IS THE BOARD ITSELF. `/workspaces/<id>` with nothing under it — the
 * board record and the board delete — is left to its own routes, because that
 * one path fronts TWO stores: the id is a board's, or an attachment set's,
 * dispatched by which store knows it. An existence check here would have to
 * ask both, and asking the doc store means scanning every doc on every
 * request. The routes that already dispatch by id keep doing it.
 *
 * ONE COLLECTION BYPASSES THIS ENTIRELY, and it is the exception rather than
 * an oversight: `/workspaces/<id>/events:stream` is served ABOVE this
 * middleware, in `routes/upgrade-stream.ts`, because an SSE open is taken
 * over rather than answered and every gate a long-lived connection has must
 * be decided at its handshake. So it keeps an existence check of its own —
 * and that check asks a WIDER question than this file's: a stream exists for
 * a board OR for any attachment set with a member doc, because task events
 * and a review's thread events broadcast on the same `ws~<id>` channel. This
 * one does not, which is correct for both and is why neither can be deleted
 * in favour of the other.
 *
 * The cost of an exception is that it is the one route this file's own test
 * would never exercise, so the collections table in
 * `test/workspace-scope.test.ts` lists `events:stream` on purpose — the route
 * that bypasses the middleware is the route most worth probing, and a table
 * that skipped it would be silent about exactly the path nothing else covers.
