/**
 * Host-based access control for a server that is reachable over a public
 * tunnel.
 *
 * Three rules live here. The first two were learned from a security review
 * (2026-08-05); the third is the owner's 2026-09-02 call, below.
 *
 * 1. **Default-deny by host.** The cloudflared ingress forwards EVERY
 *    hostname under the share wildcard to this process. The old gate only
 *    challenged requests whose Host matched an ACTIVE share, so any other
 *    hostname — `anything.tunnel.example.com` — sailed past the Access check
 *    and reached the full API (list every doc, read/write any doc over the
 *    websocket, bind arbitrary folders). Trust is now an allowlist: local
 *    hostnames bypass, everything else must authenticate. A host we do not
 *    recognise is denied even when Access isn't configured at all — a
 *    misconfigured deployment must fail closed, not serve the API to the
 *    internet.
 *
 * 2. **Share scoping.** Passing Cloudflare Access proves the visitor's email
 *    domain is allow-listed for ONE shared doc; it says nothing about the
 *    rest of the server. Without scoping, an external reviewer could
 *    enumerate every bound doc (titles + absolute filesystem paths), open any
 *    doc's websocket, and mint or revoke shares. A share host may therefore
 *    reach only the app shell and the shared doc's own endpoints.
 *
 * 3. **Access on every browser-facing hostname** (Bryan, 2026-09-02: *"Every
 *    access including share link or reading requires sign in via one time
 *    code or otherwise… Let's make everyone go through cloudflare access. No
 *    internal hole."*). `accessOnly` is that rule, and the server turns it on
 *    by default.
 *
 *    THE RULE: the only zone that reaches this server without a verified
 *    Cloudflare Access identity is a process on the box — a request whose
 *    Host is a loopback name AND whose socket peer is a loopback address.
 *    Every other hostname is browser-facing, so it must classify into a kind
 *    that verifies an Access token (`share`, `collab`, `proxied-local`) or be
 *    denied.
 *
 *    THE HOLE IT CLOSES, in two halves. The first is the tailnet and the LAN:
 *    `tailscaleHost`, `lanHosts` and `extraHosts` classified `local`, so any
 *    browser on the private network read every board, doc, attachment, file
 *    tree and diff, and opened any Yjs socket, with no identity at all. The
 *    second is that `local` was decided from the `Host` header, which the
 *    client writes: measured 2026-08-17, a LAN client and a tailnet client
 *    each sending `Host: localhost:1` were both classified local, so the
 *    first half could be walked around by typing. Requiring the peer address
 *    to be loopback is what makes "on the box" a fact the kernel reports
 *    rather than a claim the caller makes.
 *
 *    What it does NOT close: a process already running on the box. That is
 *    inside the trust boundary either way — it can read this server's memory.
 *
 * All three are pure predicates so they can be unit-tested without a server,
 * and are additionally exercised at the HTTP layer — the route layer is the part
 * nothing type-checks (see docs/process/learnings.md).

   * The FOURTH list, and by far the narrowest grant: not the product, not the

   *
   * - **No `accessFronted`.** Cloudflare Access is a browser flow. Recall's
   *   backend has no browser and no way to acquire a token, so an Access
   *   application in front of this hostname would refuse every real caller —
   *   which is the whole reason the exemptions this replaces existed. The
   *   credentials the two routes carry are what authenticates them.
   * - **No `viaProxy` requirement.** That veto exists so a tunnel visitor
   *   cannot claim `Host: localhost` and be served the product; there is no
   *   product here to serve. Requiring it would also break any deployment
   *   fronted by something that is not Cloudflare (no `cf-ray`), turning a
   *   working bot into one that joins, records, bills and delivers nothing.

 * - Loopback is the whole of `127.0.0.0/8`, not just `127.0.0.1`.
 *
 * `null` answers false. `requestIP` returns null for a socket that has
 * already gone away, and "I could not read the peer" must never authorise a
 * privileged operation. `0.0.0.0` and `::` are bind wildcards rather than

 * May a request on a COLLABORATION host touch this path?

 * for whichever workspace the path names, rather than for one workspace fixed
 * at mint time. That is the whole difference between this and a share host:
 * a share hostname carries its scope, and a collaboration hostname is one
 * stable address whose scope is decided per request.
 *
 * TWO conditions, both required. The path must be in scope for the workspace
 * it names, AND the visitor must be a member of that workspace. Passing
 * Cloudflare Access proves only that the operator admitted this email to the
 * HOSTNAME; it says nothing about which boards behind it that person was
 * given, so without the second condition every admitted email reached every
 * workspace on the server by id. `isMember` is that condition, and it is
 * asked about the same workspace the scope verdict was made about — one
 * derivation, so the two halves cannot answer about different boards.
 *
 * A path can name MORE THAN ONE workspace, and both conditions are asked of
 * each in turn. A doc filed on two boards belongs to both; taking only the
 * first — whichever the store happened to iterate first — asked membership
 * about a board the visitor was never given and refused them a doc their own
 * board shows them. So the candidates are walked in order and the answer is
 * the first that satisfies BOTH, which is also the workspace the request is
 * then served as: redaction and scoping run against a board this visitor
 * really holds, never against one they merely reached through.
 *
 * A path that names NO workspace — the app shell, the widget bundle, the
 * favicon — is not membership-checked, because there is nothing to be a
 * member of. That is the whole of what an admitted non-member reaches.
 *
 * It is ONE rule, not two. Everything else is answered by `shareScopeAllows`
 * with the path's own workspace as the target, so the operator verbs a share
 * visitor is refused — the doc list, share administration, folder binds, diff
 * creation, DELETE, `content`, `reparse_from_disk`, the landing page — are
 * refused here by the same lines, and a route added to one is added to both.
 * A second allowlist would agree today and drift later, and the one that
 * drifts open is the breach.
 *
 * Returns the target as well as the verdict because the caller needs it: the
 * request is served as an untrusted visitor scoped to that workspace, exactly
 * as a share visitor is.

 * are read-only on the board gate, comments are their only write". That reason

 * board this doc is filed on, so turning a comment into one is the same act
 * by a shorter route. It is allowed now.

 * shared doc resolves (id, title, status, assignee) without the visitor
 * ever syncing the workspace board doc.
