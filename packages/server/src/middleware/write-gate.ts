/**
 * Sign in before you write.
 *
 * `CW_REQUIRE_EMAIL_AUTH` governs what a session MEANS — with it on, the
 * server's verdict about who you are outranks the name your request claimed.
 * It has never governed whether you need one. Every refusal the auth work
 * shipped sits on the sign-in routes themselves, so an ordinary write — a
 * comment, a task edit, a doc edit — has always been accepted from a browser
 * that presented nothing at all, attributed to whatever name it typed.
 *
 * This module is the missing half: the predicate that says a particular
 * request is an ordinary write from a browser that has proven nothing, and
 * must be refused with instructions rather than accepted with a guess.
 *
 * Three deliberate boundaries.
 *
 * 1. **Reads are never gated.** GET and HEAD pass whatever the flag says.
 *    Everyone who can reach this server can read it; that is the product.
 *    A handful of routes are POSTs only because a batch of inputs does not
 *    fit in a query string; `isReadShapedPost` names them, and they pass
 *    too.
 *
 * 2. **Agents are not browsers.** An MCP tool, a curl, a webhook and the
 *    plugin's own hooks write over loopback or the tailnet with no session
 *    and no way to get one — a gate that caught them would take every agent
 *    offline the moment it was switched on. The line between them and a
 *    browser is `isBrowserRequest`: browsers attach `Origin` and the
 *    `Sec-Fetch-*` family to every non-GET themselves, from privileged code
 *    a page cannot reach, and no HTTP client in this repo sends either. This
 *    is an ATTRIBUTION boundary, not an authorization one — a determined
 *    non-browser caller can decline to look like a browser, and already
 *    could write before this existed. What keeps THAT caller out is the host
 *    gate and Cloudflare Access, both of which run above this.
 *
 * 3. **The sign-in flow cannot be gated by the thing it exists to satisfy.**
 *    `/api/auth/*` is how a browser stops being unsigned; gating it would
 *    make the switch a deadlock — no session, so no writes, so no way to
 *    post the email that mints one.
 */
