 * Bryan, 2026-08-29: *"Asking to go to an item with only vaguely relevant
 * words has never worked (eg 'I want to go to the Cairn review doc in
 * QB')."* The fast path handed the whole index to Haiku and accepted only an
 * EXACT id back, so a vague name either matched nothing or matched whatever
 * the model felt like. Title similarity is a thing this process can compute
 * itself, in microseconds, and — unlike the model — it can say HOW SURE it
 * is. That number is what lets the router ask "which one?" instead of
 * guessing: wrong-but-confident navigation is worse than asking.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and table-testable. The router (voice.ts) owns
 * what to do with the answers.
