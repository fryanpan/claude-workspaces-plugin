/**
 * ── Request admission: may this request reach this server at all, and as whom ──
 *
 * The first thing that happens to every request and the last line of defence
 * in front of everything else: the default-deny host gate, the auth branch
 * its decision selects, the external-access master switch, and the scoping
 * that turns an admitted outsider into a `visitor`. Plus the origin policy
 * the CORS layer and the cross-origin write gate both read, because "may a
 * page at this origin talk to us" is the same question one layer out.
 *
 * ── Why the result is a discriminated union ──
 *
 * This family differs from `board-membership.ts`, `stall-wiring.ts` and
 * `home-pane.ts` by one property that governs its whole shape: it is
 * PER-REQUEST, not a set of long-lived closures. It cannot be a factory of
 * values, so it has to hand something back — and the obvious something, a
 * record of `{ response?, visitor, accessEmail }`, is the bug this shape
 * exists to prevent. A caller can read `visitor` off a record whose
 * `response` it forgot to check, on a path the gate meant to refuse. That is
 * exactly the hazard the exceptions row predicted when it named this seam.
 *
 * So: `{ admitted: false, response }` carries NO per-request values, and
 * `{ admitted: true, … }` carries every one of them. TypeScript will not let
 * `gate.visitor` be read until `gate.admitted` has been checked, so the
 * refused path cannot leak a value by omission rather than by decision.
 *
 * `admitted: false` means "the gate has answered this request", not "denied".
 * The share-link redeem route lives inside the gate — it is the one path on
 * that hostname a non-member may reach — and its 200 comes back the same way
 * a 403 does, because both end the request here.
 *
 * ── Why TWO factories ──
 *
 * `policyFor` is an INPUT to `createIdentitySetup`, and that setup's
 * `accessOnlyBrowserHosts` is an INPUT to the host gate. No single
 * composition point sits on both sides of that, so the origin policy is
 * built where it is needed first and passed into the admission factory
 * built after. One module because they are one subject; two calls because
 * the identity setup genuinely sits between them.
