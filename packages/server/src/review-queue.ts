 * What is waiting on a PERSON, across every surface a workspace has.

 * The board's decisions strip answers a narrower question — open decision
 * tasks — and everything else that genuinely needs Bryan has been invisible
 * from the board: an agent's question on a task discussion, a doc comment
 * nobody answered. Those are one act ("someone needs you") wearing three
 * surfaces, and splitting them across three places to look is what makes
 * coming back to the board mean scrolling a chat history instead.
 *
 * This module computes the rows: the two thread-shaped kinds, and — since a
 * ticket HAS review items rather than IS one — the rows hanging on tickets.
 * `reviewItemRows` is the whole queue in one order. The client's `reviewQueue`
 * (board-review-model) still owns the PRIORITY rule that ranks a row against the board's
 * own task rows, which is what keeps that judgement in one pure, testable place
 * instead of split across the wire.
 *
 * The server owns this half for one reason: "is this comment an agent's" is
 * `classifyActor`'s judgement, and it must not be re-decided here. A second
 * notion of who counts as an agent is exactly the drift this codebase has
 * already been bitten by.

 * precisely so the item at most risk of never being answered comes up first
 * (see `since`), and a caller that merged two separately-sorted lists would
 * silently get two queues stapled together instead.
 *
 * The tie-break is the row's own address, so it is total across kinds: a thread
 * row breaks on `threadId` exactly as it always did — which is what keeps a
 * thread-only workspace's output identical to `reviewThreadItems`' — and a
 * ticket row breaks on `taskId:reviewItemId`, since the derived legacy id
 * (`r-legacy`) is deliberately the same string on every legacy ticket.
