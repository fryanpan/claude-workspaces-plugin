/**
 * Running the plugin update — the deliverable half of shipping that a
 * session can perform for itself.
 *
 * `plugin-release.ts` answers "who is behind". This answers "fix it", and the
 * two belong together: a drift signal nobody can act on from where they read
 * it is a nicer way of being stuck.
 *
 * Three things make this safe to expose to every peer on the board, which was
 * the condition for opening it up at all (Bryan, 2026-08-14):
 *
 *   - **It cannot interrupt anyone.** The update rewrites a version-keyed
 *     cache directory and the `installed_plugins.json` pointer. No running
 *     session is touched: a session resolved `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` at launch
 *     and keeps loading the bundle it already points at. Peers take the new
 *     version at their next restart — their own next safe point, not the
 *     instant somebody else asks. So "request a refresh, don't force one" is
 *     a property of the mechanism here rather than a promise in a doc.
 *   - **It takes no arguments.** The argv is fixed. Nothing a caller sends
 *     reaches a process.
 *   - **There is no shell.** The resolved binary is spawned directly with an
 *     argv array. That matters more than it looks: on this machine `claude`
 *     is a shell FUNCTION that injects flags ahead of the subcommand, so a
 *     shelled-out `claude plugin update …` is parsed as a prompt and dies
 *     with "Input must be provided … when using --print" — an error a
 *     previous session read as a permission refusal and wrote up as an agent
 *     being unable to deploy at all.
