/**
 * Proof that a caller IS the agent whose feed it is asking for.
 *
 * Two routes are keyed on an agent id rather than on a doc or a board:
 * `GET /api/agents/<id>/watches` (the durable watch set) and
 * `GET /events/agent/<id>` (the multiplexed stream that fans that set out).
 * Both were gated on one thing only -- not being a share visitor -- and an
 * agent id is `agentIdForName(name)`, a pure hash of a name that is written
 * on the board in plain sight. So knowing a peer's NAME was enough to derive
 * their id, and knowing their id was enough to open their whole feed: every
 * comment, every task event, every board they watch, on one socket, without
 * knowing a single doc id.
 *
 * This module is the whole answer, and it is deliberately two layers,
 * because they close different doors and only one of them needs a client
 * change.
 *
 * ## Layer 1: the caller's SHAPE. No client change, closes today.
 *
 * The only legitimate caller of either route is the MCP child Claude Code
 * spawns per session. That process is always three things at once: it talks
 * to loopback, it is not a browser, and it did not come through the edge.
 * So the three refusals the agent-merge route already carries apply here
 * unchanged, and for the same reasons spelled out there:
 *
 * - **Not through the edge.** cloudflared runs on this box, so a tunnelled
 *   request also has a loopback peer address; only `cf-ray` says it crossed.
 * - **Loopback peer address**, on the SOCKET rather than the Host header,
 *   which is client-controlled. This is what shuts the tailnet out.
 * - **Not a browser.** A page served from this machine also has a loopback
 *   peer address and rides the owner's session cookie, so without this a dev
 *   server on another local port could read any agent's feed with a single
 *   `fetch`. This is the largest of the three doors.
 *
 * Every MCP child on every shipped bundle already satisfies all three, so
 * this layer costs no rollout and is enforced unconditionally.
 *
 * ## Layer 2: WHICH agent. Needs a client change, so it rolls out.
 *
 * Layer 1 still lets one local non-browser process read another's feed, and
 * the requirement is that the caller prove it is that agent. There was
 * nothing to build that proof on: `packages/mcp/src/http-client.ts` sends
 * `content-type` and nothing else -- the MCP child holds no session token
 * today -- and its id is a hash of a public name. So this adds one: an `at1`
 * bearer, minted at `GET /api/agents/<id>/token` behind the Layer 1 gate and
 * presented as `Authorization: Bearer at1.<agentId>.<mac>` on both routes.
 * Stateless: nothing is stored, the MAC is the whole record, and rotating the
 * key file on disk revokes every token at once.
 *
 * **What it is honestly worth.** The mint route is behind the same gate as
 * the routes it unlocks, so a local non-browser process can still mint any
 * agent's token. That is not a hole this module could close: sessions
 * running as one OS user share a single trust zone, which is what
 * `.claude/rules/security-posture.md` says in as many words. The proof is
 * worth exactly this much -- it closes the browser, the edge and the tailnet
 * outright at Layer 1, it makes a WRONG token a refusal rather than a silent
 * cross-agent read, and it is the hook `requireAgentTokenForStreams` hangs
 * on once the fleet is past the deprecation window. It is not claimed to be
 * more.
 *
 * ## No expiry, on purpose
 *
 * `expiresAt` answers null. The MCP child holds this for the life of a
 * session -- sometimes days -- and the stream loop has no re-mint path, so a
 * TTL would end the fleet's event delivery mid-session, which is precisely
 * the failure `/events/agent/` was built to end. The session cookie makes
 * the same call for the same reason; `auth/widget-token.ts` is the format
 * that DOES expire, and says there why it differs. Revocation here is key
 * rotation.
