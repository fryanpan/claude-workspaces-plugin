/**
 * The six-digit login code.
 *
 * A code and not a magic link, and that is not a style preference: the app is
 * an installable PWA (`display: standalone`), and on iOS a home-screen PWA
 * keeps its own cookie jar. A link tapped in Mail authenticates Safari and
 * leaves the PWA logged out — the reviewer would watch the login succeed in
 * the wrong window. A code is typed into whichever window asked for it.
 *
 * Six digits is a million guesses, which is only enough because three limits
 * hold at once, and each one closes a hole the others leave open:
 *
 * - **Attempts per challenge (5).** Bounds grinding one code. Exhausting
 *   them consumes the challenge, so the sixth guess cannot be the first of a
 *   fresh five.
 * - **Starts per email (5 / 15 min).** Bounds the OTHER grind — requesting a
 *   thousand codes and guessing one each — and doubles as the mail-bomb
 *   limit, since every start sends a message to an address the requester does
 *   not have to own.
 * - **Starts and attempts per peer address.** An attacker with a list of
 *   addresses is under no per-email limit at all; this is the only one that
 *   sees them. Held deliberately looser than the per-email ceiling, because
 *   several honest people can share one address behind a tunnel or a NAT.
 *
 * Above the sliding windows sit two hourly ABUSE CEILINGS — per peer and
 * global — that bound how much mail this server can be made to send at all;
 * see `CEILING_WINDOW_MS`. They refuse differently: not a 429 but an answer
 * the route makes indistinguishable from success, plus a loud log line.
 *
 * The code is stored HASHED with a per-challenge salt and compared
 * timing-safely, for the same reason a password would be: this file's map is
 * read by anything that can read the process, and a memory dump or a stray
 * log line should not be a set of live credentials.
 *
 * In-memory on purpose. A challenge outlives neither a restart nor ten
 * minutes, and persisting it would put a live credential on disk to buy back
 * a case — "the server restarted while I was reading my mail" — whose whole
 * cost is asking for another code.
