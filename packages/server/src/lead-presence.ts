/**
 * Whether a meeting's asks have anybody to land on — and telling the doc
 * page when that changes.
 *
 * A meeting doc's floats and spoken asks all address the board's LEAD seat:
 * Make Plan, Review, "can you research X", a task said aloud. Every one of
 * them files fine into an empty doc, and until this existed the doc
 * looked the same either way — the ask sat in a queue nobody was draining,
 * and the person who asked found out an hour later. So the doc says it,
 * plainly and persistently, while it is true: no lead agent is listening,
 * asks will queue until one attaches. Recording is never held up by it.
 *
 * "Attached" is the store's own word for it, not a new one: the lead seat is
 * held AND its holder is deliverable — a stream open, or observed within the
 * delivery window — which is what `hasLiveLeadAttachment` gates board-wide
 * requests on. Merely connected is not enough, for exactly the reason that
 * predicate exists: a session that attached and died an hour ago would
 * still be "attached" by the roster and would answer nothing.
 *
 * The push is change-only, and it goes only to docs a page has ASKED about
 * (the GET registers the doc): presence is a property of the board, so one
 * seat change would otherwise fan out to every doc the board ever held. A
 * sweep re-reads the watched docs on a short clock because the delivery
 * window closes silently — nothing fires when a heartbeat simply stops.
