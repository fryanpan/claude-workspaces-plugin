/**
 * Who may reach this server, over which hostname — built once, from the
 * settings this deployment resolved.
 *
 * The composition root has two halves already: `server-config.ts` decides
 * what the environment says, and `server-deps.ts` builds the adapters that
 * talk OUT (Postmark, Recall, the deployer). This is the third piece and it
 * faces the other way: the sharing registry, the share-link store, the
 * sharing master switch, and the three Cloudflare Access verifiers with the
 * host lists each of them arms. It reads no environment and serves no
 * request; what comes back is a bag of long-lived collaborators the request
 * chain then consults.
 *
 * They are one family rather than five because the three verifiers are
 * written in terms of each other. A shared one would refuse every
 * collaboration request with `no_share_for_host`, and the fail-closed rule —
 * null, and the whole host list ignored, unless BOTH halves are configured —
 * is stated three times because it has to hold three times. Splitting them
 * would leave that rule in one file and the lists it governs in another.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim out of the top of `createServer`.
