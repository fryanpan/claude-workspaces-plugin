/**
 * Correcting a note OUT LOUD: "no, I said Thursday" fixes the note that says
 * Tuesday, instead of the doc growing a second note that disagrees with the
 * first one.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A COMPOSE. The composer already revises — it sees the
 * outline and may answer with a `replace_block`, and it is told to "correct
 * earlier notes the new speech overturns". What it cannot do is be RELIED ON
 * to: the block it rewrites is re-emitted from a model's reading, so the same
 * ask lands as a fix on one tick and as an extra bullet on the next, and the
 * fix costs the bullet's marks and anchors either way. A person saying two
 * words wants two words changed. So a correction is a TARGETED,
 * in-place replacement, exactly as a speaker rename is (`relabelNotesSection`)
 * and for the same reason: a two-word fix must cost no more than two words.
 *
 * WHAT VOUCHES FOR IT. The two halves are vouched by different things, and
 * that asymmetry is the design:
 *
 *  - the CORRECTED words are vouched by the transcript. They were just
 *    spoken, so `correctionSpokenOnTick` can ask the tick's own window.
 *  - the MISTAKEN words are vouched by the NOTES. They usually are in the
 *    transcript too — the note was composed from it, mishearing included —
 *    but by the time the correction is spoken the tick that carried them can
 *    be well outside the overlap window. So the guard is stronger than a
 *    transcript match rather than weaker: the phrase must actually be in a
 *    note, in exactly ONE note, and that resolution is what makes the
 *    correction land on something real. A phrase the model invented matches
 *    nothing and the correction is dropped.
 *
 * AND WHY MORE THAN ONE MATCH IS A DROP. Three notes saying "Tuesday" and a
 * person saying "no, Thursday" is not a correction anybody can execute: fix
 * the newest and two stale ones remain and the choice looks arbitrary; fix
 * all three and the edit is wider than the words asked for. Ambiguity is
 * dropped, the way every other reading in this pipeline drops what it cannot
 * prove — the transcript is still the record, and the next compose still sees
 * the correction in the speech.
 *
 * A PERSON'S NOTE IS NEVER OVERWRITTEN. Ownership is the block's own
 * `cwAuthor` (`prose-outline.ts`): the agent may revise only a block it wrote
 * that no person has touched since — the doc clears the mark the moment they
 * do, so those are one question with one answer. When the only note carrying the mistaken phrase
 * is one a person wrote — or one the agent wrote and the person has since
 * edited — the correction lands as a REDLINE SUGGESTION on that phrase, the
 * same `suggestOps` mechanism the composer already uses when it wants
 * different words in somebody's line. Accepting it is their move. The two
 * cases are deliberately different verbs, not one verb with a flag: revising
 * your own note is bookkeeping, and proposing a change to somebody else's is
 * a request.
 *
 * A SPEAKER TAG IS OUT OF BOUNDS. A site sitting inside `[@Devi](speaker:B)`
 * is an ATTRIBUTION, and rewriting its text while the href still names voice
 * B would leave the tag claiming that B is called something B is not.
 * Attribution moves by the reassign gesture; it never moves by a spoken
 * correction of the words around it. Same law `attributesToNewVoice` holds
 * the composer to from the other side.

 *
 * A plain scan, not a RegExp: the phrase is arbitrary words a person spoke,
 * and escaping them for a pattern is a bug waiting for the first correction
 * with a dot or a bracket in it. Case-insensitive because the model quotes
 * the phrase from speech while the notes carry it as the composer capitalised
 * it — "thursday" and "Thursday" are the same correction, and refusing the
 * pair would drop the ordinary case.
 *
 * WHOLE TOKEN, or correcting "ten" would reach inside "attention".
 *
 * The boundary is UNICODE-AWARE, and deliberately not the rename's
 * `extendsWord`. That one asks `[A-Za-z0-9]`, which is right where it lives:
 * an engine label is a single ASCII letter, so "Speaker A" only ever needs to
 * be told apart from "Speaker AB". A correction is arbitrary words somebody
 * SPOKE, in whatever language the room speaks, and an ASCII rule reads every
 * accented letter as a word boundary — correcting "ana" would rewrite the
 * tail of "mañana", because the "ñ" before it does not look like a letter.
 * Combining marks count too, so a decomposed "ñ" (n + U+0303) is not a
 * boundary either. Found by `codex review`.
 *
 * And the folding is LENGTH-PRESERVING, because an offset found in a folded
 * copy is used to edit the ORIGINAL. `String.prototype.toLowerCase` is not a
 * per-character map: "İ" (U+0130) lowercases to TWO code units, so one such
 * letter earlier in a note shifts every offset after it by one, and the
 * correction lands a character to the right of the word it meant. The
 * whole-token guard turns most of that drift into a silent miss rather than a
 * misplaced edit, which is the better failure and still the wrong one — a
 * person's correction disappearing with no note of why. Folding one character
 * at a time and keeping the original wherever its lowercase is not exactly one
 * unit costs those few letters their case-insensitivity and keeps every offset
 * true. Also found by `codex review`.
