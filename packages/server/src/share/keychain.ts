/**
 * Read a generic-password entry from macOS Keychain.
 *
 * READ ONLY. Storing a value a person handed over through a review item is
 * `../secret-store.ts`, which shares the binary and nothing else — its runner
 * takes stdin, because the one rule of a write is that the value never
 * reaches an argument list.
 *
 * Set up the entry once with:
 *   security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s "<serviceName>" -w "<value>"
 *
 * The lookup is by SERVICE, tried under the login account first and then
 * under any account. The service name is what every install hint in this
 * repo agrees on; the account has not been — one hint said `-a "$USER"`, a
 * review item said `-a claude-workspaces` — and an entry stored under the
 * "wrong" account made a configured engine report itself as unconfigured
 * (Soniox, 2026-08-31). The account-scoped attempt stays first so a user
 * with two entries for one service gets their own.
 *
 * Returns the password or throws with that exact install hint embedded so
 * the operator can copy-paste a fix on the first failure.
