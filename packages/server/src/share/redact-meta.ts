 * ON THE ADDRESS. These eight review routes used to answer at

 * that alias: `/workspaces/<id>/…` is a BOARD's address now, and an
 * attachment set is not a board (`routes/review-files.ts`,
 * `host-guard.test.ts` asserts the retired spelling reaches nothing). The
 * prefix-stripping pass that moved the board's own routes rewrote these
 * comments along with them, which pointed the rationale for a live gate at a
 * path nothing serves.
 *
 *   - `root`, the ABSOLUTE filesystem path of the shared directory on the
 *     host. Directory names routinely encode a client or project, so this is
 *     the same class of disclosure the private-meta sidecar exists to prevent.
 *   - `reviewUrl` on every node, carrying the tailnet hostname AND port —
 *     an internal name the visitor has no business learning, and one they
 *     cannot use anyway.
 *
 * Both are dropped/relativized here. `relPath` deliberately stays: it is the
 * path WITHIN the review, which is the thing being reviewed and is already
 * visible in the sidebar.
 *
 * Verified live against the running server before the fix: an external
 * visitor on a workspace link received both.
