/**
 * Share LINKS: `https://share.<domain>/s/<id>`, and the workspace membership
 * redeeming one creates.
 *
 * The design Bryan chose on 2026-09-03 (option A on the share-links options
 * doc). ONE Cloudflare Access application covers the whole share hostname,
 * with an "everyone" policy and a one-time PIN login, so Cloudflare proves an
 * email address and nothing more. This module owns the other half of the
 * question — may THIS email open THIS workspace — which is the half the
 * security model has always kept on our side of the line.
 *
 * The split from `shares.ts` is deliberate rather than tidiness. A `Share` is
 * a Cloudflare Access APPLICATION: it carries a hostname, an audience, an app
 * id, a policy id and an allow list, and minting one needs an API token on the
 * box. A `ShareLinkRecord` is a row in a file. They answer the same product
 * question through completely different machinery, and putting the new one
 * inside the old type would mean every field on it being optional and every
 * reader asking which kind it holds. `shares.ts` stays for the records already
 * minted (see the retired-once-drained notes there and in auth-share.ts).
 *
 * Three rules the rest of the server depends on:
 *
 *  1. **A link is not a credential for the workspace, it is an invitation to
 *     become a member.** Redeeming writes the verified email down against the
 *     workspace, once; from then on every request is judged on the MEMBERSHIP,
 *     never on the link. So revoking a link cannot eject the people who
 *     already came through it — `removeMember` is that, and it is a separate,
 *     deliberate act.
 *  2. **A link that is not live records nothing.** Revoked, expired and
 *     never-existed are one answer to a caller (`state`), because three
 *     answers would let anyone with the route enumerate which ids are real.
 *  3. **Expiry is optional and defaults to none.** Bryan, 2026-09-03: links
 *     are long-living. `expiresAt: null` is a link with no expiry, which is a
 *     different thing from a link whose expiry has passed, and the two must
 *     not collapse into a falsy check.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to Cloudflare, and nothing here needs an API token.
