/**
 * May THIS caller point a cross-reference at THAT thing?
 *
 * A `Ref` is the one field a member can write that names something by id
 * without the id ever appearing in the path. The host guard reads paths, so
 * it never saw these: a member allowed to file and edit rows on their own
 * board could store `{kind:'task', taskId:'<a row on another board>'}` on one
 * of them, and backlinks are COMPUTED per read — so the pointing row then
 * showed up as a chip on a board that member was never given, written from
 * outside it. The read side was already filtered (`GET /api/tasks/<id>/links`
 * drops backlinks from other boards); this is the write side of the same
 * rule.
 *
 * The rule is the guard's own, not a second one: the ref's target must
 * resolve to a workspace the request is already scoped to. `workspacesOf` is
 * `shareWorkspacesOf`, the same resolver `shareScopeAllows` and `collabScope`
 * read, so "inside this board" has one answer in this server.
 *
 * A NON-EXISTENT target answers exactly the same as a target on somebody
 * else's board — both resolve to no workspace and both are refused. That is
 * deliberate and it is the whole reason the check reads this way rather than
 * "does it exist and is it mine": refusing only the foreign ones would turn
 * this route into the doc list one id at a time, which is the existence
 * oracle `POST /workspaces/<id>/docs` records in `workspace-content.ts`.
 * The cost is that a member cannot store a dangling annotation the owner
 * still can, which is a fair trade for not answering "is this id real".
 *
 * The owner and every agent are unaffected: `visitor` is null for a request
 * from the box, and this answers true without asking anything.

 * and a made-up one with the same `unknown-after`. So this check closes no
