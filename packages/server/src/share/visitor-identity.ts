/**
 * What a share visitor is allowed to claim about who they are.
 *
 * Every write endpoint takes its `author` straight from the request body —
 * fine on the tailnet, where the only callers are Bryan's browser and his
 * own agents, but a share link puts that body in a stranger's hands. Left
 * alone, a visitor could post a comment signed `known-bryan / "Bryan"`, and
 * `/activity` went further and DEFAULTED to Bryan when no author was sent.
 * Feedback that looks like it came from the person who asked for it is
 * worse than no feedback.
 *
 * The rule: a visitor picks their DISPLAY NAME (they should — an animal or
 * a real one, see guestNameFor), but never their identity. The id is
 * server-derived and lives in a `guest-` namespace that can't collide with
 * `known-*` or with an agent's, and reserved names are refused.
 *
 * Not anti-spoofing between guests: two visitors on the same link are
 * equally trusted by design, and one can type the other's name. What this
 * stops is a visitor claiming to be a member of the fleet.
