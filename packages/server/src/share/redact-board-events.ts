/**
 * Visitor redaction for board events riding the workspace SSE feed.
 *
 * The ws:<id> board doc enforces the §3.3 visitor contract via projectTask
 * (transition actors as display names only). The SSE feed
 * broadcasts the RAW store events — full Task objects and TaskActor records
 * with ids — so without this, granting a visitor the feed (§3.12 commit 8)
 * would leak through the second door exactly the way DocMeta once did
 * (redact the REST payload, forget the long-lived transport; see
 * docs/process/learnings.md, "Anything in the Yjs doc is readable...").
 *
 * Pure and total: unknown events pass through untouched, so this can sit in
 * every visitor stream's write path without a maintained event list. Only
 * board-shaped events (task.* / decision.* / review_item.* / workspace.* /
 * agent.* / triage.* / voice.*) are rewritten. Two fields carry ids — `actor`
 * (TaskActor) and `task` (a full Task) — and `voice.request` carries the
 * one field the §3.3 enumeration never granted: the utterance itself.
 */

/**
 * The prefixes this rewrites. It is the whole of what `events.jsonl` holds —
 * `TaskEventBus.appendAudit` writes every `TaskStoreEvent` and nothing else —
 * so a prefix missing here is a row the Activity tab (`GET …/events`) and the
 * board's SSE feed both hand a visitor unredacted.
 *
 * `review_item` was the one that was missing. Its three events carry the
 * asker as a full `TaskActor`, whose `id` is derived from an email, and they
 * were passing through untouched while `decision.*` beside them — the answer
 * to the very same ask — was reduced to name and kind.

 * after it. A transcript is unbounded free speech about whatever the
 * speaker is thinking ("hold the release until legal clears the
 * acquisition question"), which makes it the highest-variance field on the
 * feed and the last one to grant by default. What survives is enough for a
 * visitor to see that someone spoke and which route took it: event, route,
