/**
 * RETIRED — nothing in the server calls this module.
 *
 * Link mode was retired on 2026-09-02: no share is minted as a signed URL,
 * and `/share/<id>` redeems nothing (`routes/auth-share.ts`). The only
 * importer left is this module's own test, which also cross-checks the
 * retired edge Worker in `infra/share-link-worker/`. It is kept, not
 * deleted, and it is excluded by name from `ship-it`'s security trigger.
 *
 * Do not add a caller. A new signed value goes through
 * `auth/signed-token.ts` as a `TokenFormat` (security-review checklist,
 * heading 5), never through the hand-rolled HMAC below.
 *
 * What follows is the original description, kept for the record.
 *
 * Signed share URLs — the S3-presigned pattern.
 *
 * A share link is `/share/<id>?exp=<unix-seconds>&sig=<hex>`: the id says
 * which share, `exp` says until when, and `sig` is an HMAC-SHA256 over
 * `<id>.<exp>` under a key only the server (and the edge Worker, as a deploy
 * secret) holds. Nothing in the URL is secret on its own — the signature is
 * the credential, and it covers the expiry, so neither can be changed
 * without the other going stale.
 *
 * Two independent verifiers run the SAME check: the Cloudflare Worker in
 * `infra/share-link-worker/` gates `/share/*` at the edge, and the server
 * re-validates on every request as defense-in-depth — the app never trusts
 * that the Worker ran. Both use Web Crypto (`crypto.subtle`) so one
 * implementation shape verifies in both runtimes; the HMAC key material is
 * the UTF-8 bytes of the key STRING (the hex file content as-is, no hex
 * decode), because that is the one convention a copy-pasted Worker secret
 * cannot get wrong.
 *
 * The URL's `exp` is embedded at issue time from the share's `expiresAt`,
 * so the existing TTL tooling feeds it; the registry's own `expiresAt` is
 * still re-checked per request, which is what makes early revocation work
 * (a revoked share refuses even a validly signed URL).
