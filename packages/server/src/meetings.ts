/**
 * A doc's meetings: which one is live, and where the words are kept.
 *
 * WHY THE TRANSCRIPT IS APPEND-ONLY JSONL. The live transcript revises itself
 * — a turn is rewritten in place until the engine settles it — and a file
 * that tracked those revisions would be rewritten several times a second for
 * the length of a meeting, with a torn write costing the whole recording. So
 * only SETTLED turns are written, one line each, and nothing already on disk
 * is ever touched again. A crash costs the sentence in progress, not the
 * meeting; a torn tail line is skipped on read the way `events.jsonl`'s is.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS AN INDEX AND IT IS ALSO APPEND-ONLY. A notes agent arriving
 * afterwards needs to enumerate a doc's meetings without opening every
 * transcript, and a meeting learns its end time an hour after it learns its
 * start. Rewriting the header at stop would be the one mutable file in a
 * durable record; instead the stop appends a second line for the same
 * `meetingId` and a read folds them. Same reason, same shape, no rewrite.
 *
 * Nothing here deletes. Soft delete is project-wide, and a transcript is the
 * least reconstructible thing this server holds — the audio is gone.
