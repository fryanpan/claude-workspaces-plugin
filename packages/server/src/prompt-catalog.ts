/**
 * Every prompt this server sends to a model, in one list.
 *
 * Six call sites, found by grepping `packages/**` for the messages endpoint
 * and confirmed one by one. The list exists so the settings page can be a
 * list rather than six hand-written rows, and so a new prompt is one entry
 * here instead of a page edit plus a route edit plus a store edit.
 *
 * The PURPOSE line is what the reader sees under the name, and it is written
 * for the person tuning the words rather than for the person maintaining the
 * module: what it does for them, and — folded into the same sentence rather
 * than carried by a second field — roughly when it fires. "While the room
 * talks" is when; it is not a separate column, because a column of timing
 * chrome is chrome the reader cannot act on.
 *
 * SCOPE is where the words are stored, not a label anybody sees. `server`
 * prompts live in `<dataDir>/prompts.json` (`prompt-store.ts`); `board`
 * prompts are fields on a board's own record and are written through
 * `PUT /workspaces/<id>/settings`, which is where they already lived.
 * The page deliberately does not say which is which — one owner, one machine,
 * and a label he cannot act on is a label that costs a line and buys nothing.
 *
 * It follows that EVERY EDITABLE ROW IS EDITED ON THIS PAGE, including the
 * two board-scoped ones. The review criteria also have a field in the board's
 * own settings panel and keep it; both are editors over the same server-side
 * field, each reading it fresh when it opens. Sending that one row off to a
 * popover instead would have made a row that looks exactly like its six
 * siblings behave unlike any of them, which is the wrong-target surprise the
 * page is shaped to avoid.
