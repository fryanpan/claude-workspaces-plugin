/**
 * Which rows the stall loop may name — work that was supposed to be moving
 * and has stopped.
 *
 * ── How this differs from `ready-gate.ts`, which sits next to it ─────────
 *
 * That gate answers "is there work nobody has picked up", and it deliberately
 * refuses to use a clock: a measurement across two real boards found the
 * median gap between task events at about fifteen minutes, so an elapsed-time
 * test flagged working agents at roughly the rate it flagged stalled ones.
 * Read its header before changing anything here — the numbers are all there.
 *
 * This gate asks the opposite question. A row that is `in-progress` has an
 * owner who said they were on it, and the only evidence available that they
 * stopped IS the silence. So the clock is unavoidable here, and the honest
 * thing is to state where it is weak rather than to pretend otherwise:
 *
 *  - **The recipient is the lead, not the worker.** A false positive costs
 *    one check-in by somebody whose job is already to know the board's state.
 *    The measurement that killed the clock next door was about interrupting
 *    the agent mid-flow, which is a much more expensive mistake.
 *  - **Every state that EXPLAINS the silence is checked first**, and each one
 *    is dependency state rather than a second clock: a filed question waiting
 *    on a person, a deliberate park with a date, an unfinished dependency, a
 *    goal outside every ranked band. A row only reaches the clock once none of
 *    those can account for it.
 *  - **The threshold is configurable and the default is somebody's decision,
 *    not a measurement.** Twenty minutes is Bryan's, and the reasoning is in
 *    the constant below.
 *
 * ── Why the verdict carries three lists ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `stalled` is work that should be moving and is not — the lead drives it.
 * `unfiled` is a different failure wearing similar clothes: a row waiting on
 * a person with no question filed anywhere they read. Nobody is failing to
 * work it, so it is not a stall, and the remedy is to file the ask rather
 * than to chase the owner. Merging the two would hand the lead one list with
 * two incompatible actions in it. It runs on the same clock as `stalled`,
 * for the reason given where the gate is applied below: an ask that was
 * created a minute ago is one the lead may well be in the middle of filing.
 * A row reaches it two ways — a person owns it, or its band is the owner's
 * own queue — and nothing else: the row's prose is never read for a wait
 * (rebuild step 2). A row that IS legitimately waiting carries the address
 * of its filed item, and the verdict lists those rows too (`waiting`) so a
 * later reader can check the ask rather than trust the bucket.
 *
 * `undetermined` is the load-bearing one, and it is the same argument
 * `ready-gate.ts` makes: a row whose review items cannot be parsed answers
 * "no open questions" identically to a row that genuinely has none — and an
 * open question is precisely what would have exonerated it. Such a row is not
 * named as stalled and is not counted healthy either. It is named as unread,
 * so the silence about it belongs to somebody.
