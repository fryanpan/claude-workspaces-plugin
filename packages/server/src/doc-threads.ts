   * Answer a Review Item: post the person's words as a reply, and record

   * resolved thread and still emits the events watching agents receive.
   *
   * What this no longer leans on is "a person spoke" as the RECORD that it
   * happened. That reading held only while every person's comment in the
   * thread was an answer, and the task panel's single composer made that
   * false: it aims an ordinary remark at the newest comment's thread, so a
   * line of small talk retired an unanswered decision and took its card with
   * it. So the answer is stamped onto the declaration (`answeredAt`, plus
   * `answeredWith` when the words came from an option) and the queue reads
   * that. One field, written in one place, so the two spellings this comment
   * used to warn about still cannot disagree.
   *
   * `optionId` is provenance only, mirroring `answer_decision`'s split: `text`
   * is always the verbatim answer, and the id merely records which candidate
   * the words came from. A typed answer carries no id and is not a lesser
   * answer.
   *
   * Refuses an unknown option rather than recording a dangling id — the card
   * renders the label by looking the id up, so a stale one would render as a
   * blank choice on a decision that reads as answered.
   *
   * `onlyIfUnanswered` makes the write CONDITIONAL on the item still being
   * pending, re-checked here rather than by the caller. Answering twice is
   * legitimate for a person who changed their mind — that is the unconditional
   * default, and the displaced answer becomes history. It is not legitimate for
   * a reply that was folded into an answer only because the item looked open
   * when the request was read: that caller's whole claim is "nobody has
   * answered this", and it must lose the race rather than overwrite the winner.
   * The caller then posts the words as an ordinary comment, which is what they

   *
   * Un-stamping is the whole mechanism of "Undo reopens it everywhere": every
   * queue (Home, the task panel, the doc surface) derives "waiting on you"
   * from `reviewAnswered` on the declaration, so clearing the stamps re-offers
   * the item on every surface with no second state to sync.
   *
   * Refuses when there is nothing to take back rather than succeeding
   * vacuously: two readers racing the same undo must not both be told they
   * took something back.
