/**
 * The words this server sends to a model, kept somewhere the owner can change
 * them.
 *
 * `notes-prompt-store.ts` did this for ONE prompt and its header said a
 * settings page would come later and write the same file. The page is here,
 * and it covers seven prompts rather than one — so the file beside the corpus
 * became a JSON record keyed by prompt id, and the notetaking instructions
 * moved into it (see `migrateLegacyNotesPrompt` below).
 *
 * `<dataDir>/prompts.json`. Beside the data rather than in the repo, because
 * what the note-taker is told is this deployment's setting and not this
 * project's source. Four properties are carried over from the store it
 * replaces, and each one was learned rather than chosen:
 *
 * READ PER CALL, NEVER CACHED AT BOOT. Editing the words and watching the
 * next note change is the whole loop this exists for, and a restart in the
 * middle of a meeting to pick up a wording change is not a loop anybody runs.
 * The cost is one small synchronous read against a model call.
 *
 * AN EMPTY VALUE MEANS THE DEFAULT, not an empty prompt. A note-taker sent no
 * instructions at all writes something, and what it writes would be blamed on
 * the model rather than on the blank field that caused it.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS. A corrupt or unreadable file is reported once and every
 * prompt falls back to its default, because notes that stop mid-meeting are a
 * worse failure than notes that read the way they did last week.
 *
 * RESTORE-DEFAULT IS A SOFT DELETE. It moves the current words into
 * `previous` and clears `value`; it never destroys what was written. That is
 * the project-wide rule, and it matters more here than usual — these words
 * are hand-tuned against real meetings and there is no other copy of them.

 * The longest prompt this server will store.

 * 4,000 was the ceiling the two board-scoped prompt fields shipped with, and
 * a cap that refuses the shipped default it is protecting is a field nobody
 * can use.
 *
 * Measured against the shipped defaults on 2026-09-06, longest first:
 * the notetaking instructions 5,807 characters, meeting capture 4,594,
 * thread summary 3,274, voice router 1,640, effort estimate 1,432, waiting
 * on you 658, review criteria 656. TWO of them are over the 4,000 this
 * product used to enforce, and one of those is the notetaking instructions —
 * the prompt this page exists to make editable.
 *
 * The markdown rewrite (2026-09-11) brought the longest default down to
 * 3,654. The cap did not move with it: an override written before then can
 * be the old 7,979-character notes prompt reworded, and it has to stay
 * saveable.
 *
 * 16,000 is the longest shipped prompt with room to roughly treble it, which
 * is the room a person rewriting one actually needs — a prompt gets longer
 * as rules are added to it, not shorter. Raised here and imported by
 * `routes/workspace-settings.ts` rather than written twice.
 *
 * Still a ceiling rather than none: every call sends the whole thing, and
 * prompt length is this subsystem's one real cost lever.
