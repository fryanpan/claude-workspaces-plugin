/**
 * Recall's realtime frames, turned into the `EngineTurn`s the rest of the
 * meeting assistant already understands.
 *
 * This file is pure: no sockets, no clock, no vendor calls. Everything that
 * makes a bot meeting different from a microphone meeting is a decision about
 * NUMBERING and NAMING, and both are decisions a test should be able to drive
 * with a list of frames.
 *
 * WHY TURN NUMBERS HAVE TO BE INVENTED HERE. AssemblyAI's own stream carries
 * `turn_order` and the direct engine passes it through. Recall does not: a
 * `transcript.data` event is one finalized utterance with a participant and a
 * word list, and nothing in it says which utterance it is. But every stage
 * downstream — the append-only record, the strip, the notes composer's
 * revise-in-place — is keyed on a turn number that is stable while a turn is
 * being revised and new when a new turn starts. So this module allocates them.
 *
 * THE RULE, and why it has a same-words clause bolted onto it:
 *
 *   A partial opens a participant's turn; a final settles it. A final that
 *   arrives on an already-settled turn opens a NEW one — UNLESS its words are
 *   the same words, in which case it is a re-emission and revises in place.
 *
 * The "same words" clause is there for the double-final. AssemblyAI with
 * `format_turns` on ends every turn TWICE at the same turn order — the
 * unformatted text first, the punctuated text immediately after — and the
 * direct engine tells them apart by requiring both of its flags. Recall
 * normalises its providers and the flags do not survive, so if both finals
 * reach us they arrive as two indistinguishable `transcript.data` events. Two
 * turn numbers would put the sentence in the transcript twice, once without
 * punctuation.
 *
 * The clause is narrow in two ways, because the failure it must NOT cause is
 * the opposite one — a genuine utterance merging into the previous turn and
 * vanishing, since `recordTurn` ignores a repeat of a turn already written.
 * Words that differ are always a new turn. And words that ARE the same only
 * count as a re-emission inside {@link REEMISSION_WINDOW_MS} of the final they
 * repeat: the formatter's second pass follows the first immediately, whereas a
 * person saying "Yes." twice does not. Without the window, two identical
 * one-word answers become one and the second is lost — raised by review.
 *
 * The window is the honest discriminator available, not a certainty. Recall
 * normalises its providers and may well emit only the formatted final, in
 * which case this clause never fires — but if both do arrive they are
 * otherwise indistinguishable, and a transcript with every sentence in it
 * twice, once unpunctuated, is the worse of the two failures to ship blind.

 * the other's words is not. Disambiguating at the seam is cheap and keeps the
 * downstream guard for the case it was written for.
 *
 * An unnamed participant gets "Guest N" rather than falling through to
