/**
 * One reading of a task-create body, shared by every route that accepts one.
 *
 * There are now two: `POST /workspaces/<id>/tasks` (one task) and
 * `POST /workspaces/<id>/tasks/batch` (a burst). They must agree on every
 * field — validation, defaults, and above all who owns the result — and the
 * route layer is exactly the layer nothing type-checks, so two hand-copied
 * copies of this would drift the first time a field is added to one of them.
 * That has already happened twice in this repo (`groups` accepted and
 * discarded; `actor` never forwarded on import). So the copying happens here,
 * once, and both routes call it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the store's job: the store takes a `CreateTaskOpts` and is
 * the gate for what a task may BE. This is the gate for what a REQUEST may
 * say, which is a different question with different error shapes (a 400 the
 * caller can act on, per field).
