/**
 * "This description is older than the conversation about it."
 *
 * A task body is a MEASUREMENT taken on the day it was filed, and the board
 * renders it forever as a present-tense description of the world. On a
 * codebase that moves several times a day the two drift apart silently, and
 * the only thing standing between a stale premise and building the wrong
 * SIZE of fix is an agent being told to reproduce first — which costs 10-30
 * minutes per pickup and only fires for agents who were told.
 *
 * The signal this module reads is already recorded and needs no new
 * bookkeeping from anybody: when a previous reader discovered the premise had
 * moved, they SAID SO on the task. In all five known instances they did
 * exactly that, in prose, in a comment — and in none of them did it reach the
 * next reader, because the pickup path (`buildQueue` -> `next_tasks`) returns
 * `body` and drops the discussion. So the body's own correction was sitting
 * one API call away from every agent that re-derived it from scratch.
 *
 * **What the MCP verb does with this changed, and the sentence above is now
 * about the ROUTE.** `/workspaces/<id>/next` still returns everything below,
 * notes included. The `next_tasks` tool projects it: a drifting row reaches
 * the agent with this block's dates, `headline` and a note COUNT, and the
 * notes themselves come back on `fields: ["id","premise"]`. The half that had
 * to arrive unprompted still does — an agent is told, without asking, that
 * the description it is about to act on has been contradicted — and only the
 * transcript moved behind an advertised fetch, because carrying every note of
 * every drifting row on the queue read cost more than the queue was worth.
 * See `packages/mcp/src/task-projection.ts`.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a claim that the body is WRONG. It is the much
 * weaker, checkable claim that the description has stood still while the
 * conversation moved on — and the remedy is to hand the reader the notes
 * rather than to make a judgement for them. Nothing here is a status, and
 * nothing here can be mistaken for one: see `decidePremiseDrift`'s first
 * silence.

   *
   * Uncapped HERE, and still uncapped on every read of this route. The
   * `next_tasks` MCP tool is the one reader that summarises them — a note
   * count in place of the text, with the text one named `fields` call away.
   * That is a preview, and the paragraph above is the argument against one;
   * the argument was weighed and lost to the measured cost of carrying every
   * note of every drifting row on the most frequent read on the board. Read
   * `packages/mcp/src/task-projection.ts` before assuming an agent has these.

/**
 * Fires only when the description has stood still while the task was

 *
 * Four silences, each of which is a case where firing would be noise:
 *
 * 1. **A done task is always silent.** Structural, not cosmetic: it is what
 *    guarantees this reading can never be confused with marking the task
 *    complete. The signal is defined only on work somebody may still pick
 *    up, so "this premise is stale" and "this task is finished" are not
 *    merely different values — they live on disjoint sets of rows. Four of
 *    the five known instances still had real work in them after the premise
 *    was corrected, which is exactly why the two must never be conflated.
 *
 * 2. **A description newer than every note is silent.** A correction resets
 *    the clock, so the author has already accounted for what was said. This
 *    is what makes the fix additive: rewrite the body and the notice clears
 *    itself, with no separate acknowledge step to remember.
 *
 * 3. **A task nobody has said anything about is silent.** An untouched row
 *    is unstarted, not contradicted. Without this the whole backlog lights
 *    up on age alone, which is the arming failure that trains people to
 *    ignore the strip.
 *
 * 4. **A gap under `staleAfterMs` is silent.** "Filed this morning,
 *    discussed this afternoon" is a conversation.
