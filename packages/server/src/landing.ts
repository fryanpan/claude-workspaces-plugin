/**
 * What the landing page is FOR: a list of active workspaces to open up.
 *
 * That sentence is Bryan's, verbatim (from the task that asked for it, 2026-08-18):
 * "please don't build the overengineered version. Let's just have a simple
 * workspace list and not overlap with the purpose of each workspace home
 * page which is also being built." The previous `/` — a cross-workspace
 * "Needs you" band over every thread on the server plus a grouped index of
 * every review artifact — was that overlap. Anything about ONE workspace's
 * state (its queue, its decisions, its catch-up) belongs to the workspace's
 * own page at `/workspaces/<id>`; `/` only has to get you there.
 *
 * Two rules survive from the previous model, because they were measured the
 * hard way (see the git history of this file and docs/process/learnings.md):
 *
 *  1. **Recency is real events, never `meta.lastActivityAt`.** That field is
 *     derived from the `.ydoc` file's mtime (`doc-store.ts` `withActivity`), so a
 *     server-side snapshot rewrite refreshes it: on the live server all 3,741
 *     docs reported activity inside 7 days, in identical-millisecond
 *     clusters. `lastActivity` here is computed by the collector from task
 *     mutations (`task.updatedAt`), task-thread comments
 *     (`thread.lastActivity`), goal edits and board creation — timestamps
 *     that only move when someone does something. This module's input type
 *     deliberately has no field to put an mtime in.
 *  2. **A cut list states what it cut.** Inactive workspaces are not hidden —
 *     they are behind a labelled, counted fold, because a filtered list that
 *     does not say what it filtered reads as the whole truth ("An empty list
 *     is a clearance only if you also render the denominator").
 *
 * The review-doc index (the "hundreds of bound review items" the old page
 * drowned in) stays reachable through one small fold of per-project links to
 * `/projects/<owner>` — a link, not a browser.
