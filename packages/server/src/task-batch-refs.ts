/**
 * Dependencies BETWEEN rows of one batch.
 *
 * `after` has always been able to name a task id you already hold. Inside a
 * batch you hold none of them — the ids are minted as the rows land — so
 * until now a burst with any internal ordering needed a second call
 * (`set_task_dependencies`) after the fact. Pushing every create through the
 * batch makes that gap louder, not quieter, so a row can now name another row
 * of the SAME batch.
 *
 * Two spellings, one meaning:
 *   - a number, or `"#<digits>"` — the 0-based index of a row in this batch;
 *   - `"#<key>"` — the `key` another row of this batch declared.
 * Anything else is an existing task id, exactly as before.
 *
 * ## Why the sigil is required
 *
 * Without it, `after: ["seed"]` would need a precedence rule between "a key
 * in this batch" and "a task id". A field that is sometimes caller-authored
 * and sometimes derived is this repo's most reliable bug generator, and the
 * failure mode here is the silent one: `openBlockers` skips an `after` id it
 * cannot resolve, so a mis-resolved edge does not error, it just never
 * blocks. With the sigil, resolution is total — a `#` entry is batch-local
 * and nothing else, an entry without one is an id and nothing else.
 *
 * Everything that could make a reference ambiguous is refused where the key
 * is DECLARED rather than at each site that reads it: one refusal, one
 * message, and no reachable-only-in-the-field branch.
 *
 * ## Why backwards only
 *
 * Rows are created in the order given, so a row can only depend on a row
 * ABOVE it. A forward reference is refused rather than wired up in a second
 * pass, because the second pass has to answer "the row you depend on failed,
 * so you now exist with no edge" — and a task carrying a dependency that
 * never blocks it is precisely what `unknown-after` was added to prevent.
 * The same reasoning is why a reference to a row that FAILED fails this row
 * too, instead of quietly dropping the edge.
