/**
 * The note-ask detector's network half: ask Haiku whether a task note says
 * the agent is waiting on a person.
 *
 * The same split, the same key and the same failure policy as
 * `review-judge.ts` — read its header for the reasoning, none of which is
 * repeated here. What differs is only the size of the question:
 *
 *  - **One note, one word back.** The prompt is a sentence and the answer is
 *    `yes` or `no`, so `max_tokens` is tiny and the timeout is short.
 *  - **It only ever narrows.** The caller sends a note the deterministic
 *    prefilter already flagged (`note-ask.ts`), so a `no` cancels a finding
 *    and a `yes` confirms one. A note the prefilter passed over is never
 *    sent, which is what bounds the spend: at most one call per new ask-note,
 *    ever, and none at all on a board whose notes have already been judged.
 *  - **Every failure leaves the prefilter standing.** No key, a timeout, a
 *    non-2xx, an unparseable reply — all `null`, which `NoteAskClassifier`
 *    caches as nothing and treats as "the prefilter was right".
 *
 * `createServer` takes it as an option with NO default, the summarizer's seam
 * rule: nothing that merely spins a server up can reach the network.
