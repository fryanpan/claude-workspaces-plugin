/**
 * The reconnect cursor of a MULTIPLEXED agent stream: one `Last-Event-ID`
 * value carrying a per-key position.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT JUST AN ID. On a per-key stream the cursor is a single wire
 * id and `replayAfter` anchors on it exactly. One stream carrying N keys has
 * N positions, and they cannot be collapsed into one: event ids are
 * `<boot>:<n>`, so two ids from the same process are ordered — but the moment
 * the server restarts, the boot nonce changes and nothing about the old ids
 * is comparable with the new ones. A single global cursor would therefore
 * report a gap on every quiet key after every deploy, which is exactly the
 * vacuous-gap wave `SseBus.lastEver` was written to end.
 *
 * So the client presents what it actually knows: the last id it DELIVERED on
 * each key it has heard anything on. A key with no entry gets no replay
 * attempted and no gap notice — identical to a per-key stream that has never
 * received a frame, which is the semantics this format is preserving rather
 * than inventing.
 *
 * WIRE FORMAT (v1):
 *
 *     mux1:<key>=<eventId>,<key>=<eventId>,...
 *
 * A watch key matches `agent-watches.ts`'s `KEY_RE` — letters, digits and
 * `_ . : ~ -` — and an event id is `<8 hex>:<counter>`. Neither can contain
 * `=` or `,`, so those two separators need no escaping, and splitting a pair
 * on its FIRST `=` is unambiguous.
 *
 * DUPLICATED, ON PURPOSE. The MCP bundle imports nothing from the server —
 * `packages/mcp/scripts/build.ts` bundles a standalone file and pulling
 * `@claude-workspaces/core` in would drag yjs into it — so the encoder lives at
 * `packages/mcp/src/mux-cursor.ts` and this is the decoder. The two are
 * pinned together by `packages/server/test/sse-mux.test.ts`, which imports
 * the client's formatter and parses its output here; change one and that
 * test fails rather than the fleet going quiet.
