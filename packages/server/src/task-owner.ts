 * writes with an author — so resolve the owner from that, and refuse the
 * create when even that comes back generic.
 *

 * is a display name, and a display name cannot be pattern-matched into a
 * person or an agent without being wrong for somebody — silently, and in the
 * direction that inflates the one strip built to stay short. So the kind is
 * DECLARED (`declaredAssigneeKind`) and read back with the workspace's own
 * agent roster as the standing evidence (`resolveOwnerKind`).

 * heartbeat, when it was last seen working, what bundle it runs — stops at
 * the board's edge. Expressed as one function with the predicate defined in
 * terms of it, because two matchers over the same roster are two things that
 * can disagree, and this file already carries the scar of a roster half that
 * silently matched nothing.
 *
 * Generic over the attachment so this module stays free of `tasks.ts` (which
 * imports it — the dependency only runs one way) and so the caller decides
 * what to expose. It returns the record as-is: redaction of host-machine
 * fields belongs to whoever serves it, not to the matcher.
 *
 * The RESERVED owners never resolve, whatever the roster holds, and this is
 * a DECISION rather than a gap — read the next paragraph before "fixing" it.
 *
 * `agent` is the value every session with no configured name collapses into,
 * and `human` means "a person, unnamed". Both are shared or anonymous by
 * construction, so a match on them names an arbitrary session rather than the
 * one that did the work. Measured on the live board 2026-08-19: the generic
 * identity carried **858 of 7,727 activity events**, produced by multiple
 * distinct sessions that are no longer distinguishable — the information that
 * would separate them was never captured, so no join can recover it.
 *
 * Returning nothing there is therefore the correct answer and not a missing
 * feature. **A wrong attribution is worse than an absent one, because nothing
 * downstream can tell that it is wrong**: an owner with no session reads as
 * unknown and invites a look, while an owner with the wrong session reads as
 * fact and ends the question. The tempting change — treat the null as a gap
 * and match the roster anyway — silently converts every one of those rows
 * into a confident lie.
 *
 * `resolveOwnerKind` already returns before its roster check for exactly
 * these two, so this adds no new behaviour there; it puts the rule in the one
 * place every future caller inherits it, rather than trusting each to
 * re-derive it.
