/**
 * Effort scoring: what one ticket is estimated to cost, and the pass that
 * re-asks when the question itself changes.
 *
 * Two halves of one thing. Scoring is event-driven — it fires on create, on a
 * retitle, on a body edit and on a re-triage — and none of those events
 * happen when the PROMPT changes, so the boot pass exists to re-ask every
 * open row whose estimate predates the current ask. Both call the same
 * `runEffortEstimate`, and the re-project after a write is the same rule in
 * both: `recordEffortEstimate` is deliberately quiet, so a score nobody
 * refreshes is a score that did not happen.
 *
 * Nothing here can block or fail a request. A server with no estimator wired
 * does nothing at all, every call records its own failure on the row, and the
 * boot pass is deliberately sequential with a gap so it cannot spend the rate
 * limit live edits need.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim out of `createServer`.
