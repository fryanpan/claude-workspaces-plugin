/**
 * The work queue — "what do I pick up next" (§3.9, agent side).
 *
 * Priority is goal order then task order, which the board has always
 * rendered and no agent could READ: `list_tasks` returns goal IDS, and the
 * only goal-list tool was a destructive full replace. So ordering lived in
 * each agent's head, and "why are you working in the 1.2 band" had no
 * answer an agent could look up. This module is the lookup, kept pure so
 * the ordering rules are testable without a server.
 *
 * Two things it answers, in one pass:
 *
 *  - **Order.** Goal position, then the task's own fractional order. A goal
 *    id the list no longer has — and `chores` — ranks last rather than
 *    vanishing.
 *  - **Doable.** Open dependencies are reported; only an ENFORCED one holds
 *    a task back, matching the transition gate exactly rather than inventing
 *    a second notion of blocked.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do is decide what can run in parallel. A
 * first cut modelled that as a `lane` label plus computed waves, and it
 * earned nothing: the row carries its full description, and reading two
 * descriptions is enough to tell whether they touch the same code. Worse,
 * a lane is set at CREATION time — the moment a task's author knows least
 * about what it will end up touching — so the schema would have frozen a
 * guess made at the worst possible moment and invited callers to trust it
 * at execution. `blockedBy` carries the dependency half, which is real data
 * someone stated on purpose; the judgment half stays with the reader.
