/**
 * "Link that to the existing task" — heard, and answered from a loose
 * description.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE `notes-references.ts`. That module links the row
 * somebody NAMED, and it is deliberately strict about it: a citation nobody
 * asked for is a claim about what the discussion was about, so it demands a
 * contiguous run of the title's own words. That strictness is right for an
 * unprompted citation and wrong for an instruction. When a person says "link
 * that to the existing task" they have already decided the link should exist;
 * what they have not done is quote the title. They said "the volume rocker
 * being too stiff" and the row reads "Volume buttons". A matcher that needs
 * the words back gives them nothing, and the owner's verdict on the first
 * version was exactly that: finding existing tasks did not work well.
 *
 * So an ASK is scored differently from a MENTION, by the board's own
 * related-work index (`@claude-workspaces/core/related-work`) rather than by title
 * runs. That scorer already answers "is somebody already working on this?"
 * from a sentence, which is the same question in a different room, and
 * reusing it means the notes and the planning flow agree about what "related"
 * means. The scorer is imported, never the MCP verb: this runs inside a tick,
 * and a tick may not make a network call.
 *
 * THREE OUTCOMES, AND THE THIRD IS THE POINT.
 *
 *   • Asked, and one row is clearly ahead → LINK it. The person asked.
 *   • Asked, and two rows are neck and neck → SUGGEST both. A coin flip
 *     between two plausible rows is how a wrong link gets written, and a
 *     wrong link is worse than a question: nobody rereading the notes can
 *     tell it was a guess.
 *   • Not asked, but a row scores well above the mention threshold →
 *     SUGGEST it. This is the owner's second half — "suggest tickets to add
 *     if it's not sure but probably has some related tickets" — and it is
 *     why the unasked path may not simply stay silent.
 *
 * A SUGGESTION IS A LINK THE READER TAPS, not a caption saying a link might
 * belong. It is written into the note as ordinary markdown whose href carries
 * `suggest=1`; the client turns a tap on it into the real link and rewrites
 * the text (`notes-link-affordance.ts`). Written that way it degrades to
 * something useful with no JavaScript at all — a reader who opens the bound
 * `.md` sees a question with the row behind it — and it costs the doc no node
 * type, no chip and no explanatory sentence.
