/**
 * The board waking its lead.
 *
 * Everything else on this server is reactive: somebody calls a tool, an
 * event fans out, an agent that happens to be listening reads it. That
 * leaves one gap the board can see and nothing acts on — **ready work
 * nobody has picked up.** The rows are there, they are `todo`, they are
 * owned by an agent, nothing enforced blocks them, and the session that
 * would do them is sitting idle waiting to be spoken to. Until now the only
 * thing that could close that gap was Bryan noticing and typing something,
 * which makes the human the scheduler for work the board already ranked.
 *
 * So: a timer reads the board and, when ready work has stood still longer
 * than the idle window, sends ONE frame addressed to the workspace's lead
 * agent. The frame rides `sendToAgent` on `ws~<workspaceId>` — the same
 * addressed delivery `triage.requested` uses, and for the same reason. It is
 * a DELIVERY, not a change, so it deliberately does not go through the
 * store's emit choke point and never reaches `events.jsonl` (§3.6's table is
 * the exhaustive audit contract and has no nudge row).
 *
 * ── Why most of this file is about NOT sending ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A wake costs a turn. A nudge that repeats every tick while nothing has
 * changed costs a turn every tick, and the lead learns — correctly — that
 * the signal carries no information. Then the one nudge that mattered
 * arrives into a session that has already been taught to skim past it. So
 * the arming rule is stated as a STAMP rather than as a cooldown:
 *
 *     stamp = <effective last activity> | <the ready set, sorted>
 *
 * A workspace is nudged at most once per stamp. That single rule covers
 * both halves of the requirement without a second timer: any activity moves
 * the activity clock, and any material change to what is ready moves the id
 * list. A cooldown would have been the obvious shape and it is the wrong
 * one — it re-fires on a schedule, which is exactly the training signal
 * above.
 *
 * Two further silences, each with a reason:
 *
 *  - **An unreachable lead is not spent.** If the lead holds no stream, the
 *    nudge is not sent AND not recorded. A wake delivered to nobody would
 *    otherwise burn the one nudge that stamp is owed, and the lead would
 *    come back to a board that had already decided it had told them. The
 *    cost is a no-op check per tick, which is free.
 *  - **A retired board is never woken**, and neither is one with an empty
 *    lead seat. There is no addressee in either case; a broadcast fallback
 *    would put a board-wide ask in front of every peer, which is the failure
 *    addressed delivery exists to end.
 *
 * The activity clock is the LATER of two sources on purpose. The snapshot
 * carries the store's own record (max `updatedAt` across the board), which
 * is durable across a restart; `noteActivity` carries what this process has
 * observed since, which covers the events that move a board without moving
 * a task row (a comment, an answer). Taking only the first would nudge over
 * a live conversation; taking only the second would nudge the instant the
 * server came up.
 *
 * ── Why the stamps are on disk ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything above describes a map that used to live only in this process,
 * which meant a DEPLOY undid all of it: prod restarts at every merge, and
 * each restart handed every idle board a clean slate and re-fired one wake
 * per board over facts their leads had already been told. That is the
 * "signal carries no information" training above, delivered by the release
 * process rather than by a timer.
 *
 * The stamp itself was already durable by construction — both halves are
 * read off the store, which is why a fresh nudger over the same board
 * computes a byte-identical string. So the fix is only somewhere to keep it:
 * one small json in the data dir, loaded at construction, rewritten when the
 * map changes. Best-effort in BOTH directions and deliberately so — a stamp
 * file that cannot be read or written costs at most one duplicate wake,
 * which is the cheaper failure by a wide margin.
