/**
 * The comment a park writes.
 *
 * Parking used to be a state on the row (`parkedUntil` + `parkedReason`), and
 * the owner's call on 2026-08-27 was that it duplicated `triage`: both mean
 * "nobody is working this, and nobody has agreed it is work yet". So the state
 * went and the verb stayed — `park_task` moves the row to triage and leaves
 * this note behind.
 *
 * That trade only works if the note carries everything the two fields did.
 * A date alone said a decision had been made and not what it was waiting for;
 * a reason alone left nobody knowing when to look again. Both halves are in
 * one line here, and the DATE leads, because the reader this is written for is
 * scanning triage for what is due back.
 *
 * Pure, and shared by the route and the startup migration on purpose: the row
 * migrated out of the old state and the row parked tomorrow have to read the
 * same, or the board's history reads as two different products.
