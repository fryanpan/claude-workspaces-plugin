   * One board as the nudger reads it: who to wake, whether to wake them at
   * all, what is ready, WHAT THE PASS EXAMINED TO SAY SO, and when the board
   * last moved.
   *
   * The candidate set is the SAME computation `next_tasks` serves —
   * `buildQueue` — rather than a second reading of the same rules, and it is
   * now asked with `includeBlocked` so the gate sees every open row it is
   * deciding about. That is what makes `considered` a real denominator: a
   * pre-filtered list can only ever report the rows that survived it, so an
   * empty `ready` would read as an empty board rather than as a board whose
   * rows are all waiting on somebody.
   *
   * Which rows survive is `evaluateReadyWork`'s call — see `ready-gate.ts` for
   * why every one of those conditions is dependency state and none of them is
   * a clock. Two things stay here because they need the store:
   *
   *  - `ownerKind`, from the projection's roster reader, so the answer is the
   *    one the board draws rather than a guess from the assignee's name.
   *  - `reviewState`, which reports open questions AND unparseable ones
   *    separately. `listReviewItems` drops a corrupt row rather than throwing,
   *    so without the second number a ticket nobody can read is indistinguish-
   *    able from a ticket with nothing outstanding — and this is the one
   *    caller that ACTS on the difference.
   *
   * Nothing here has to filter out deliberately-deferred rows. Parking moves
   * a row to `triage` and `buildQueue` never lists triage, so a park is
   * invisible to this wake by construction rather than by a second rule that
   * could drift from the one `next_tasks` follows.

   * keep-moving protocol is working, and a loop that judged "stalled"
   * differently would be measured by an instrument that disagreed with it.
   *
   * Four things have to be assembled here because they need the store:
   *
   *  - **Activity per row.** The classifier takes an event list and derives
   *    each row's last movement from it. The board's own `/events` feed has
   *    measurably MISSED row edits, so what is fed in is the rows' own
   *    timestamps — `updatedAt`, `bodyWrittenAt`, `titleWrittenAt` — which are
   *    written by every path that changes a row. That is a superset of what
   *    the feed would have carried, and it needs no file read per tick.
   *  - **Open questions.** `reviewState` reports open items AND unparseable
   *    ones separately, and this is a caller that ACTS on the difference: a
   *    ticket whose questions cannot be read is exactly the ticket whose
   *    unreadable question might have explained its silence, so it goes to the
   *    gate as unreadable rather than as clear.
   *  - **Who owns the row**, from the projection's roster reader, so the
   *    answer is the one the board draws rather than a guess from a name.
   *  - **Which goals dispatch.** The decisions band is the owner's own queue
   *    by its own description; everything else in the ranked list dispatches,
   *    and a goal outside the list is formal backlog that the dispatch rule
   *    would never start.
   *
   * Comments are resolved in a SECOND pass, and only over rows the first pass
   * called stuck. A comment is the row moving — a ticket whose whole decision
   * conversation is live on its thread is not quiet — but reading every board's
   * every thread once a minute would be the one expensive thing in this loop,
   * and the rows that would benefit are precisely the handful about to be

   *
   *  - comment-borne review rows (`task-thread` / `doc-thread`) — ALL of
   *    them, which is true again since 2026-08-21: membership moved into
   *    `reviewThreadItems` (a row is a declared item or a surviving direct
   *    ask), and the browser retired its undeclared shelf and places every
   *    row this route ships. Between those two changes this count briefly
   *    included inferred rows Home never drew — "something needs you" over a
   *    list that showed nothing,
   *  - open decisions, which Home draws from the board projection as its own
   *    `decision` rows.
   *
   * Person-owned blockers are deliberately NOT a term. A blocker is task
   * state, not a review item — the browser's `reviewQueue` stopped placing
   * blocker rows when the task panel's blocked note took them over, so a
   * count that still included them pointed the brief ("queued below") at a
   * queue that renders nothing.
   *
   * TICKET-borne rows (`kind: 'task-review'`) count too — Home places them
   * now (`reviewQueue` in hub-model.ts), which closed the measured gap where
   * a review item filed with `create_tasks` / `add_review_item` was shipped
   * by the route and rendered by nothing. The one exception is the DERIVED
   * `r-legacy` row: its legacy decision is already counted from the tasks
   * below, and the browser skips that row for the same reason, so counting
   * it here would say one question twice.
   *
   * The open-decision term is counted from the TASKS rather than from `items`,
   * even though `items` also carries a derived `r-legacy` row per open
   * decision. Same reason: `decisionQueue` in the browser is what draws those
   * rows, and it reads `needs`/`answer` off the projection. Counting the
   * derived rows instead would tie this number to a row Home does not read.

   * because a hundred-file review is one unit of work, not a hundred.
   *
   * A REVIEW (`meta.setId`, returned as `reviewId` by `bindDiff`) is the tag

   * Note the board page no longer LISTS attachments: the Docs and
   * Open-threads rails came out (Bryan, 2026-08-18, "remove docs and live

 * which hub it came from; `view` adds the workspace NAME so the thread reads
 * without anyone resolving an id.
 *
 * `identity-scope="host"` is what makes the feedback ATTRIBUTED. The widget
 * normally keeps its identity under a `cfw:` prefix so it cannot touch a
 * third-party host page's storage — but this page is ours, and the hub has
 * already asked the reader their name (`ensureUserIdentity`, unprefixed keys).
