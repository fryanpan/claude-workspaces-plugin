   *
   *   1. a member doc's own GROUPING     (`meta.workspaceId`)

   *   that binds the member docs of one folder bind or diff review together.
   *   It is what `rooms.listWorkspaces` / `listRepoFiles` / `bindDiff` mean,
   *   and it has NO doc room of its own: `/review/<groupingId>` is a 404, its
   *   content lives under `/api/workspaces/<id>/tree|threads`.
   *
   * HUB workspace — the board (`taskStore`): goals, tasks, a name, and a list
   *   of ATTACHMENT ids in `docIds`. Helpers here say `hub` in their name when
   *   they mean this one; a bare `workspaceId` in this file means a grouping.
   *
   * An ATTACHMENT is either a doc room id or a grouping id — `POST
   * /api/workspaces/:id/docs` has accepted both since it was written, and the
   * hub sidebar resolves a grouping through the workspace endpoints
   * (`hub-sidebar.ts`). So a review goes on a board as ONE row; its members
   * stay off, because a hundred-file review is one unit of work, not a hundred.
   *
   * Every doc and every group bind belongs to a hub workspace (Bryan,
   * 2026-08-13) — and requiring one must not add a step. "Bind it, send Bryan
   * the URL" is ONE agent call, so a caller with no board in hand does not get

 * the hub UI is about the product, not about the workspace you happened to be
 * standing in, so it should reach the same place from every hub. The widget

 * which hub it came from; `view` adds the workspace NAME so the thread reads
 * without anyone resolving an id.
 *
 * `identity-scope="host"` is what makes the feedback ATTRIBUTED. The widget
 * normally keeps its identity under a `cfw:` prefix so it cannot touch a
 * third-party host page's storage — but this page is ours, and the hub has
 * already asked the reader their name (`ensureUserIdentity`, unprefixed keys).
