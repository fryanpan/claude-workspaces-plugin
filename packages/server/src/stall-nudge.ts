/**
 * The board telling its lead that work has stopped.
 *
 * The gap this closes is the one thing a board can see and nobody acts on
 * until a person notices: a row somebody claimed, or a row the queue cleared,
 * that has gone quiet. Until now the only mechanism was the lead deciding to
 * go and look — which makes the human the watchdog for a fact the board
 * already holds, and measurement of two real lead sessions found the stalls
 * ending when the owner typed, not when anybody checked.
 *
 * So: a timer reads every board, asks `stall-gate.ts` which rows have stopped,
 * and sends ONE frame addressed to that board's lead. The frame rides
 * `sendToAgent` on `ws~<workspaceId>` — the same addressed delivery the
 * ready-work wake and `triage.requested` use, and for the same reason. It is a
 * DELIVERY rather than a change, so it deliberately does not go through the
 * store's emit choke point and never reaches `events.jsonl`.
 *
 * ── Why most of this file is about NOT sending ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Identical to the argument in `ready-nudge.ts`, and worth restating because
 * it is the only thing standing between this feature and being ignored: a
 * wake costs a turn, and one that repeats every tick while nothing has changed
 * costs a turn every tick. The lead learns — correctly — that the signal
 * carries no information, and then the wake that mattered arrives into a
 * session already trained to skim it.
 *
 * The arming rule is therefore a STAMP rather than a cooldown:
 *
 *     stamp = <how many repeat windows the board's oldest row has been quiet>
 *             | <row ids, sorted> | <unreadable rows, sorted>
 *
 * A board is woken when that stamp gets WORSE — a row id that was not stuck
 * before, a higher escalation bucket, or a row the pass could not read that it
 * could read last time. A board where nothing has changed says nothing, and so
 * does a board that has got better.
 *
 * That last clause is load-bearing, and it was the first version's bug. The
 * rule was equality, so a SHRINKING set re-armed the wake exactly as a growing
 * one did: the lead was woken to file an ask, filed it, the row left the list,
 * and the next tick woke the lead again to announce its own fix. A wake that
 * re-arms on the action it asked for cannot extinguish itself — measured on a
 * live board as six wakes in one evening, none of them naming a stalled row,
 * the unfiled count walking 1→2→3→2→1. The comparison lives in `growsOn`.
 *
 * ── Why escalation is folded into the stamp ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is the one place the design departs from the ready-work wake. Ready
 * work that nobody picks up is a queue fact and saying it once is enough.
 * A row that was supposed to be moving and is STILL not moving an hour later
 * is a worse fact than it was an hour ago, and a wake that never repeats would
 * let it sit forever behind a stamp that was correct when it was written.
 *
 * The obvious shape — a second timer, or a cooldown after which the wake
 * re-fires — is the wrong one, for the reason the file next door gives at
 * length: a repeat keyed on the clock keeps firing over a row nobody can do
 * anything about, which is how a channel becomes unreadable. So the repeat is
 * keyed on the ROW'S OWN silence instead, quantised into windows. A row that
 * has been quiet for four hours re-enters the stamp when it reaches eight, and
 * a row that recovers stops escalating with nothing to cancel: it simply
 * leaves the list.
 *
 * ── What is NOT checked, and why not ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The ticket asked for a capacity condition — only wake when the lead has
 * subagent capacity free. The server cannot know that. Nothing in the store,
 * the attached-agent roster, or the event stream carries how many subagents a
 * session is running; the nearest available number counts ATTACHED SESSIONS,
 * which is a different fact that would answer the question wrongly while
 * looking like an answer. The condition is dropped rather than approximated,
 * on the ticket's own instruction. If it is wanted, the count has to be
 * reported by the sessions themselves first.
 *
 * ── Why the stamps are on disk ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Prod restarts at every merge, several times a day. A map that lived only in
 * this process would hand every board a clean slate at each restart and
 * re-fire one wake per board over facts their leads had already been told —
 * the "signal carries no information" training above, delivered by the release
 * process rather than by a timer. Best-effort in BOTH directions and
 * deliberately so: a stamp file that cannot be read or written costs at most
 * one duplicate wake, which is much the cheaper failure.

   *
   * The bucket is read off the findings a tick can see, and every tick re-arms
   * the board with it — so a remembered row that drops off the list for a
   * single pass took the bucket down with it, and the tick that saw the row
   * again read `after.bucket > before.bucket` as another repeat window
   * crossed. A wake naming a row the lead was already told about, repeatable
   * as often as the row flickers: two wakes three minutes apart in prod over
   * one row quiet for twelve hours.
   *
   * The flicker is not the row moving. An escalation item masks its anchor row

   * stand forever, and every later row's escalation would be swallowed until
   * it passed a number some other row set hours ago — which is the repeat
   * window, the thing that says a bad board again, silently switched off
   * (found in review of this fix). So the hold is remembered WITH the row it
   * came from and lasts exactly as long as that row does: `told` forgets a row
   * that has been off the list for a whole repeat window, and the hold goes
   * with it. The next row escalates on its own clock.
   *
   * Memory only, never persisted: after a restart a board falls back to the
   * stamp on disk and pays at most the one wake this file has always been
   * willing to pay for a lost stamp.

   * shrinking set moves the stamp exactly as a growing one does, so the lead
   * was woken to file an ask, filed it, the row left the unfiled list, and the
   * next tick woke the lead again over its own remedy. Six wakes in one
   * evening on a live board, `stalled=0` in all six, the unfiled count walking
   * 1→2→3→2→1.
   *
   * So three things, and only these three, are news:
   *
   *  - a row id on the list that was not on it before — a NEW thing stuck;
   *  - the board's escalation bucket higher than it was — its worst row has
   *    crossed another repeat window;
   *  - a row the pass could not read that it could read before.
   *
   * Everything else is a board getting better, and a recovery is never
   * announced: rows leaving lowers the count, and rows leaving also lowers the
   * oldest quiet time, which is why the bucket is compared for GREATER rather
   * than for difference.
   *
   * An absent stamp is a board this process has never woken, which is news by
   * definition.
   *
   * ── What "a NEW thing stuck" means, and why it is not the stamp ────────
   *
   * It used to be a row id absent from the previous stamp, and the previous
   * stamp is the board's CURRENT set — so a row that left the list was
   * forgotten and its next quiet window read as a brand-new stall. See
   * `told`: that is one wake per window, forever, on any board whose owner
   * keeps reporting. A row is news now when the board has never been woken
   * about it, or when it comes back under a different BUCKET — which is the
   * case the id-only rule was protecting, a dispatched row whose builder then
   * died coming back as `builder-silent` rather than as the same row.
   *
   * The bucket is compared out here rather than being folded back into the
   * stamp, and that distinction is load-bearing: a row changing bucket while
   * it stays on the list is most often the lead's OWN action landing, and a
   * stamp token that moved would wake them to announce it.
   *
   * Returns what changed, or `undefined` for "say nothing" — one value, so
   * the decision to wake and the account of why cannot disagree.
