/**
 * AssemblyAI Universal Streaming — the engine that produces real words.
 *
 * PROTOCOL, CONFIRMED FROM THE DOCS rather than remembered
 * (https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/streaming/message-sequence and
 * https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/streaming/endpoints-and-data-zones, read
 * 2026-08-27):
 *
 *  - `wss://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/ws`, with the whole session config as
 *    query params — `sample_rate`, `encoding`, `format_turns`. The URL is the
 *    configuration, with ONE exception: an `UpdateConfiguration` JSON frame
 *    on the open socket can change the turn-detection knobs mid-session
 *    (the live set in meeting-tuning.ts) — `session.update` sends it.
 *  - the key travels in the `Authorization` header with NO `Bearer` prefix.
 *  - audio goes up as raw binary frames on that same socket. No framing of
 *    ours, no base64, no envelope.
 *  - the server sends `Begin` (session id + expiry), then `Turn` messages,
 *    then `Termination` (audio and session durations).
 *  - a `Turn` carries `turn_order`, `transcript` — the WHOLE turn so far, not
 *    a delta — `end_of_turn` and `turn_is_formatted`. Within one turn each
 *    message supersedes the last, and `turn_order` is monotonic.
 *  - with `format_turns` on, a turn ENDS TWICE at the same `turn_order`: the
 *    unformatted final first, the punctuated one immediately after. So the
 *    settled turn is the one where BOTH flags are true, and the unformatted
 *    final is forwarded as a partial. Treating the first `end_of_turn` as
 *    settled would write the unpunctuated text to disk and then have no way
 *    to correct it.
 *  - the client ends a session by sending `{"type":"Terminate"}` and waiting
 *    for the `Termination` reply. That wait is what flushes the open turn —
 *    closing the socket instead drops whatever was being said.
 *
 * SPEAKER LABELS (https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/streaming/label-speakers-and-separate-channels
 * and the streaming API reference, read 2026-08-29): `speaker_labels=true`
 * on the same URL, supported on every streaming model, +$0.12/hr on top of
 * the session rate — SENT ONLY WHEN THE CAPTURE SAID IT WAS A CONVERSATION,
 * with `max_speakers` (1–10) beside it as a HARD CAP on how many labels the
 * session may ever hand out — absent, the count is unbounded and a room on
 * one microphone gets a new letter for a change of posture.
 * because a session's config is its URL and cannot be changed once open. Each `Turn` then carries `speaker_label` — `"A"`, `"B"`,
 * or a placeholder (`"PENDING"` / `"UNKNOWN"`) for a turn under about a
 * second of audio — and a `SpeakerRevision` arrives before `Termination`
 * listing the turns whose label the full-session pass changed. The
 * placeholder is mapped to "no speaker" rather than shown; the revision is
 * re-emitted through `onTurn` as a settled turn with its text retained, so
 * the relay needs no second channel for it.
 *
 * The socket is injected because a test of this mapping must not open one.

 * the variant seam below rather than a second adapter:
 *
 *  - `format_turns` is Universal Streaming (English and Multilingual) ONLY.
 *    On the pro model `turn_is_formatted` merely mirrors `end_of_turn`, so a
 *    settled turn is `end_of_turn` alone — waiting for a formatted second
 *    final that never differs would be waiting on a mirror.
 *  - `continuous_partials` (pro only) emits cumulative whole-turn revisions

 *    Turn frames — exactly the revise-in-place shape the seam already
 *    carries. Sent explicitly because the server turns it OFF by default
