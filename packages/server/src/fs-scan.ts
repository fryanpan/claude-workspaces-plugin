/** Filesystem scanning + file-type gating for folder binds. */

/**
 * Enumerate the files in `root`. Prefer `git ls-files` (cached + untracked,
 * honoring .gitignore) so node_modules/dist/etc are skipped for free; fall
 * back to a recursive readdir with a hardcoded skip set when the folder
 * isn't inside a git repo or git isn't available. Returns absolute paths.
 *
 * Both modes carry a floor, and they are not the same floor. See
 * `isListedFile` — this listing IS the rule for what a share visitor may
 * open, so a name that gets past here is a name a visitor can read.
 *
 * The GIT mode filters `isCredentialShapedName`: `--exclude-standard` honours
 * the ignore files, but `--others` lists UNTRACKED files, so an `.env`,
 * `.npmrc` or `id_rsa` sitting in a checkout that simply never ignored it is
 * listed and served. That is the same credential-leaving-the-box failure the
 * fallback's floor was added for, on the mode the doc called the safe one.
 *
 * The FALLBACK filters the wider `isSecretShapedName` — every dotfile on top
 * of the credential names — because out there no ignore file was ever
 * consulted. That wider rule is deliberately NOT applied to the git mode: a
 * repo's dotfiles are tracked content somebody chose to commit and a reviewer
 * has to be able to read (`.github/workflows`, `.claude/rules`, `.gitignore`
 * itself), and hiding them would break the diff review rather than protect
 * anything.

/**
 * Is `relPath` one of the files the tree SHOWS for `root`?

 * The all-files tree is `scanFolderPaths(root)` — `git ls-files --cached
 * --others --exclude-standard` in a repo — so an ignored file never appears
 * in it, and on top of that the credential names never do either
 * (`isCredentialShapedName`), because `--others` lists untracked files and an
 * un-ignored `.env` is one. OUTSIDE a repo the listing falls back to a
 * recursive readdir, which has no ignore file to honour; there the floor
 * widens to every dotfile as well (`isSecretShapedName`).
 * `openContextFile` / `openEditableFile` used to accept any path that
 * merely existed under the root, which let a caller who knew the name open
 * `.env` or a credentials dump the tree had deliberately hidden; and a
 * review root is a whole repository, reachable by a share visitor.
 * (Urgent-fixes ticket, 2026-09-02.) The rule is now the tree's rule: a path
 * opens only if the listing contains it.
 *
 * Anything under `.git/` is refused before the listing is consulted. Git
 * never lists its own directory, but a rescan is a subprocess and `.git`
 * holds the one thing (config, hooks, packed refs) that should never need
 * one to be refused.
 *
 * Cached per root so this is not a subprocess per request: a hit is served
 * from a listing up to `LISTING_TTL_MS` old, and a MISS on a listing older
 * than `MISS_RESCAN_MS` rescans once before answering — a file created a
 * moment ago (an agent writing while the reviewer clicks) is found rather
 * than refused for the rest of the window. A miss on a fresh listing stays a
 * miss, which bounds a hammering caller to one subprocess per
 * `MISS_RESCAN_MS` per root.
