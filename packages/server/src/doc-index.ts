/**
 * A doc's listing row, on disk, next to its `.ydoc`.
 *
 * Every boot loads all 5,600-odd persisted docs into memory, and roughly all
 * of that exists to answer questions that never need the document's contents:
 * what is it called, which workspace is it in, how many threads are open, when
 * did it last move. A CRDT is the wrong shape for those — it costs 62-125 KB
 * resident per doc and has to be decoded to be asked.
 *
 * So the answers are written out beside the doc. The index is DERIVED state:
 * the `.ydoc` remains the source of truth and the index can always be
 * rebuilt from it, which is what makes it safe to delete, safe to skip, and
 * safe to regenerate on a version bump.
 *
 * It is written inside `persistRoomNow`, in the same debounced write as the
 * `.ydoc` and the private sidecar, and it goes wherever the sidecar goes —
 * staged with it, restored with it, purged with it, moved with it. If the
 * three could be written or moved independently they would eventually
 * disagree, and a stale index is worse than no index: it describes a doc
 * that is not there, on a board where nobody would suspect the listing.
