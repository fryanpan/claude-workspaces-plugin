 * bounds the memory side, with one honest caveat: thread events embed the
 * WHOLE current thread (`fireEvent` in rooms.ts sends `thread.comments` in
 * full, not a delta), so a buffered event is ~1-2KB for a short thread but
 * scales with the thread's size at the time it fired — a hot thread with
 * tens of long replies can push a saturated channel's buffer to several MB
 * rather than the few hundred KB the small-thread math suggests. That is

 * worst case remains bounded per channel and drops to nothing within ten
 * minutes of the channel going quiet (the sweep below). Channels only hold
