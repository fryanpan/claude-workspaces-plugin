/**
 * Taking the raw transcript back out of a notes doc — and only ever the
 * transcript.
 *
 * For one release the note-taker appended every tick's settled words to the
 * doc under a `## Raw transcript` heading. The owner's call on 2026-09-03 is
 * that they do not belong there: the notes are the short, reviewed record a
 * person or an agent actually reads, and a verbatim transcript is unreviewed
 * raw material — useful for checking exactly who said what, and for improving
 * transcription — so it lives in the `-raw-transcript.md` sister file beside
 * the meeting's data dir and nowhere else.
 *
 * NOTHING IS LOST ONLY BECAUSE THE FINGERPRINT IS EXACT. The words this
 * deletes are in the sister file `meeting-raw.ts` composes from the same
 * folded transcript — but that is true of the old WRITER'S output and of
 * nothing else, so this removes only what that writer could have produced,
 * and every condition below is required:
 *
 * - the doc is unbound, or bound under the server data dir. The writer was
 *   gated on exactly that (`allowedIn` below is its rule, kept verbatim), so
 *   a heading in a repo-bound doc was written by a person.
 * - the heading is level TWO and reads exactly `Raw transcript`. A `###` one
 *   is somebody's subsection; the writer only ever wrote `##`.
 * - the section is the doc's TAIL. The writer put the record last and lifted
 *   it back when anything landed below it, so a `Raw transcript` section with
 *   a doc after it was not left there by the writer.
 * - exactly one block sits under it, a code block whose language is `text`.
 *   The writer's fence was always ```` ```text ````; a `json` fence, a bare
 *   fence, a paragraph, or a second block means a person has been here.
 *
 * A doc outside that fingerprint keeps its section, and the caller logs one
 * line. A reviewer found the earlier version of this deleting a transcript
 * somebody had pasted in by hand, which is the failure every clause above is
 * paying for.
 *
 * Two residuals a structural check cannot see, both pinned by tests rather
 * than hidden: in an UNBOUND doc, a person who types the writer's exact shape
 * (an `## Raw transcript` over one `text` fence at the tail) is
 * indistinguishable from the writer; and a line a person adds INSIDE the
 * writer's own fence leaves the shape intact and goes with it. Separating
 * those would mean diffing the fence against the folded transcript, which is
 * more machinery than a one-release migration earns. Accepted 2026-09-03.
