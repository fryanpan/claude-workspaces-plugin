/**
 * Turn a classification into a plan, or into NOTHING.
 *
 * This is the whole guardrail, and it ships before any writer does so it can
 * be read on its own. Four conditions, all required:
 *
 *  1. the reply parses as a well-formed action (`parseVoiceReply` above);
 *  2. the id the action needs is present in the VALIDATED context — the
 *     `resource` is the thing that context named, and both must agree, so a
 *     deictic "mark this done" spoken from the board with no detail panel open
 *     resolves to nothing rather than to whatever was nearby;
 *  3. the model NAMED an id, and it is the context's. The prompt now REQUIRES
 *     the id, which is what makes this check able to fire: while the prompt
 *     forbade ids, an id-less action was both the compliant shape and the
 *     mis-targeted shape, so the two were indistinguishable here and "mark the
 *     deploy task as done" moved whatever ticket happened to be open;
 *  4. `actor.kind` is present. `classifyActor` (activity.ts) maps a kind-less
 *     author to `agent` — so without this, Bryan's own board move is attributed
 *     to an agent, and his reply cannot reopen a resolved thread. A missing
 *     `kind` is not a cosmetic gap; it silently rewrites who did it.
 *  5. the SPEAKER's own words license the write — see
 *     `speakerLicensesAction`. This is the only condition that does not
 *     assume the model ignored whatever a share visitor wrote into the
 *     workspace text the prompt carries.
 *
 * All five are checked for EVERY verb, including the read-only `open-link`.
 * Gating a navigation on `actor.kind` is stricter than that one verb needs;
 * the uniformity is the point, because the alternative is a per-verb table of
 * which guards apply, and the verb that gets added without its row is the one
 * that writes.
 *
 * Any failure returns null and the utterance takes the agent route exactly as
 * it does today.
