/**
 * ── Socket handlers: what an open connection DOES ──
 *
 * A19's partner, and the last slice of the `server.ts` split. A19 moved the
 * decision that a socket may open and the stamp it carries;  this is the
 * trio Bun then calls for the life of that connection. Bun routes every
 * upgraded path into ONE `open` / `message` / `close`, so the first thing
 * each of them does is read back the `kind` the upgrade attached — which is
 * why these three and `routes/upgrade-stream.ts` are two halves of one contract and
 * neither reads correctly without the other.
 *
 * ── Nothing here is snapshotted ──
 *
 * The context holds three LIVE stores, not values read out of them. A doc
 * is looked up per frame (`docStore.get(ws.data.docId)`), because `ws.data.docId`
 * is re-resolved on every message for the reason the `/y/` upgrade documents,
 * and because a doc can be created, evicted or rehydrated while a socket is
 * open. The meeting relay's session map and the bot relay's token registry
 * are the same: per-connection state that must be read at call time. Hoisting
 * any of it to factory time would bind every socket this server ever opens to
 * the state that existed when it booted.
 *
 * ── The synchronous close is load-bearing ──
 *
 * `close` is NOT async, and must not become async. `createServer`'s shutdown
 * calls `server.stop(true)`, which force-closes every open connection and
 * fires this handler SYNCHRONOUSLY inside that call — before
 * `meetingRelay.dispose()`, before `taskStore.stop()`, before `docStore.flush()`.
 * Those handlers write: a meeting flushes its last sentence into the doc. They
 * run there precisely so the subsystems that receive those writes are still
 * live. An `async close` would return a promise nothing awaits, and the writes
 * would land after the stores they need had already been flushed and stopped,
 * or not at all. The ordering inside the drain is `createServer`'s to keep;
 * the synchronous shape of this handler is this file's.

/**
 * What an upgrade attaches to a socket, for every socket this server opens.
 *
 * `kind` is what the ONE websocket handler branches on: Bun routes every
 * upgraded path into the same `open`/`message`/`close`, so the audio socket
 * and the editing socket are told apart by what the upgrade attached. Absent
 * means the editing socket, which is every upgrade that predates meetings.
 *
 * `shareId` and `readOnly` are named here rather than passed as excess
 * properties, so the two upgrades that set them are type-checked against the
 * fields the handlers read (`WsCtx` in doc-store.ts, `MeetingClient` in
 * meeting-protocol.ts).
 *
 * It lives beside the handlers that READ it back rather than with the three
 * blocks in `routes/upgrade-stream.ts` that construct it. Those blocks are
 * routes; these handlers are not, and a non-route module may not import out
 * of `routes/`. Reading it here is also the better reason: `kind` exists for
 * the branch immediately below, and the two halves of this contract are
 * type-checked against each other either way. `server.ts` imports it for
 * `Bun.serve<UpgradeData>`.
