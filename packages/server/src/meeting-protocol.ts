/**
 * The `/audio/<docId>` socket, kept out of `server.ts` the way `yjs-protocol`
 * keeps the editing socket out of it.
 *
 * NOT `packages/workspaces-app/src/meeting-protocol.ts`. That file is the other
 * end of this same socket — the strip's frame parsers and its transcript fold,
 * with no lifecycle in them. Two files, one name, in two packages: this one
 * sends what that one reads.
 *
 * The wire contract itself lives in `@claude-workspaces/core/meeting.ts`, shared with
 * the browser that opens the microphone. What lives here is the half a server
 * has to get right: the socket IS the meeting's lifecycle, so every way this
 * connection can end has to end the meeting exactly once — a clean `stop`, a
 * tab closing, a network drop mid-sentence.
 *
 * NOTHING WORD-RATE GOES OVER SSE. Transcript frames ride back down this same
 * socket; only `meeting.started` and `meeting.stopped` are broadcast to the
 * doc's channel, where other viewers learn that recording is live. The SSE
 * bus keeps 200 events per channel for reconnect replay, and a conversation
 * emits that many words in about a minute — broadcasting partials would
 * evict every real doc event from the buffer for the length of a meeting.
 *
 * STAGE TIMING IS OFF UNLESS THE CLIENT ASKS. A `start` frame carrying
 * `timing: true` (the strip's `?timing=1`) makes this relay keep a ledger of
 * what it forwarded and when, and attach a block of timestamps to each
 * transcript frame. Without it no ledger is allocated, no clock is read per
 * chunk, and the wire is byte-for-byte what it was. Nothing in that block is
 * content — see `meeting-timing.ts`.
