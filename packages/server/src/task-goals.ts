   * already has — an id it does not have is REFUSED (`unknown-goal-id`),
   * never created under the caller's name. An entry with no `id` is new, and
   * the server mints an opaque one (`newGoalId`) and reports it in `created`.
   * A caller therefore cannot choose an id, and cannot change one: the two
   * gestures that used to strand a band's work are no longer expressible,
   * where before they were merely refused after the fact. Everything the call
   * always did — reorder, retitle, remove — is untouched, and none
   * of it moves an id.
   *
   * 'chores' is reserved and never present in goals[]; open tasks whose goal
   * id disappears are moved to Backlog, each emitting a
   * `task.regrouped` batched (via `partOf`) under the one
   * `workspace.goals_changed` event, and the result reports the moved ids so
   * the caller can re-place them. Deliberately NO re-triage request fires —
   * a reorder changes no placement's accuracy, and a removal already lands
   * every affected task where the caller is told to look.
   *
   * A DROP THAT WOULD STRAND WORK IS REFUSED unless `drop` names the id.
   * This is a full replace keyed by id, so the natural way to rename a band —
   * submit the list with a new id and the new title — reads here as one goal
   * removed and a different one added: the old band's open tasks swept to
   * Backlog, its done tasks left pointing at an id that is gone, and a
   * successful-looking result. The damage is proportional to how much the
   * band held, and it surfaces days later as "why is my top band empty".
   * `renameGoal` is the non-destructive way to change a title; this guard is
   * what makes the destructive path stop being the DEFAULT one. It fires
   * only for ids that actually hold tasks, so it can never refuse a call
   * that was about to lose nothing.

   * Change a goal's TITLE (and optionally its dueAt) in place, at either
   * scope, without touching its id — the common half of what `set_goal_list`
   * was being used for, separated from the destructive half.
   *
   * The whole contract is that nothing can move. A task's band is its goal
   * ID, and no reachable input here changes an id, so a rename cannot sweep
   * open work to Backlog and cannot orphan a done task. That is the point:
   * before this existed, the natural gesture for "rename this band" was to
   * submit the full list with a new id, which the store reads as a removal
   * plus an addition and which strands everything the band held.
   *
   * `chores` is refused as RESERVED rather than not-found — it is a real row
   * a caller genuinely saw in the read, and its label is fixed, so "no such
   * goal" would send them hunting for a typo. Same split `reorderGoals`
   * draws for the same reason.
   *
   * Deliberately asks for NO bucket re-look, even though a retitle can change
   * what a band means ("TBD" → "Payments" arguably makes a goal apparent).
   * The trigger is keyed on a band becoming a DESTINATION, and a rename adds
   * none: every place a task could go, it could already go. Keying it on
   * meaning instead would fire on every wording fix, and nothing in the call
   * distinguishes the two — which is how an ask that matters gets ignored
   * along with the twenty that did not. If this turns out to be worth having,
   * it wants an explicit signal from the caller, not a heuristic here.
   *
   * Emits the existing `workspace.goals_changed` with kind 'edit' (a retitle
   * IS an edit under that taxonomy), so nothing downstream needs a new case.
   *
   * DELIBERATELY NOT A RE-KEY. This verb changes the title and never the id,
   * and the obvious next proposal — "let it take a NEW id and carry the
   * band's tasks across" — is the one to resist. Read this before adding it:
   *
   *  - The demand for re-keying was never a demand for re-keying. It was
   *    people renaming, and reaching for the only verb that could restate a
   *    title. With a retitle that works, "give this band a different id" has
   *    no caller left that isn't already better served here.
   *  - It would be a SECOND bulk task-mover living beside `setTaskGoal`, on
   *    the path that has already produced this file's worst bug. Every band
   *    it moved would be moved implicitly, as a side effect of an edit that
   *    reads like a label change — which is precisely the shape of the
   *    silent stranding the `would-strand-tasks` refusal exists to end.
   *  - The honest way to genuinely retire an id is already reachable and is
   *    two explicit steps: `setGoalList` with the old id named in `drop`,
   *    then `setTaskGoal` per task. The refusal message names both, so the
   *    caller who really wanted a re-key is told where to go rather than
   *    handed a verb that moves work on their behalf.

   * is where a param quietly disappears.
   *
   * Titles and dueAt ride along untouched, and no task can move: there is no
   * reachable input to this method that regroups anything.
   *
   * `parent` is still accepted, and now always refused. It scoped the reorder
   * to one band's subgoals; subgoals are gone, so no id can name a sublist to
   * order. Refusing beats ignoring it — a caller who meant "order these
   * children" must not silently reorder the whole board instead — and beats
   * dropping the field, because the REST route has callers this server cannot
   * restart.
   * Emits the existing `workspace.goals_changed` with kind 'reorder' — the
   * event the board projection and the activity feed already render — so
