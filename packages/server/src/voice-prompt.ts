/**
 * The voice VOCABULARY, and the one model round trip written in it.
 *
 * Split out of `voice.ts` (A6). Two jobs that are really one: the shapes an
 * utterance is decided against — where the speaker is (`VoiceContext`), what
 * they are looking at (`VoiceResource`), what may be asked of them
 * (`VoiceReviewItem`) — and the prompt that renders those shapes for the
 * classifier plus the parser that reads its reply back into a
 * `VoiceClassification`. Everything here is pure: values in, values out, no
 * clock, no socket, no store.
 *
 * `VOICE_ACTIONS` lives here rather than beside the guardrail it feeds
 * because it is the CLASSIFICATION's own enum: the system prompt lists the
 * five shapes and `parseVoiceReply` refuses a verb outside them, both in this
 * file. `resolveVoiceAction` (voice-action.ts) switches over the parsed verb
 * and never reads the list itself.
 *
 * The three-layer defence this file carries two thirds of: the fence
 * (`PROMPT_DATA_BEGIN`/`END`) tells the model where instructions stop,
 * `promptSafe` denies workspace text the shape of an instruction, and the
 * third — the speaker's own words licensing a write — is `voice-action.ts`.
