  /**
   * Answer a Review Item: post the person's words as a reply, and record
   * which option they came from.
   *
   * **The answer IS the reply** — the words a person answered with are a
   * comment, there is no second answer store, and this still reopens a
   * resolved thread and still emits the events watching agents receive.
   *
   * What this no longer leans on is "a person spoke" as the RECORD that it
   * happened. That reading held only while every person's comment in the
   * thread was an answer, and the task panel's single composer made that
   * false: it aims an ordinary remark at the newest comment's thread, so a
   * line of small talk retired an unanswered decision and took its card with
   * it. So the answer is stamped onto the declaration (`answeredAt`, plus
   * `answeredWith` when the words came from an option) and the queue reads
   * that. One field, written in one place, so the two spellings this comment
   * used to warn about still cannot disagree.
   *
   * `optionId` is provenance only, mirroring `answer_decision`'s split: `text`
   * is always the verbatim answer, and the id merely records which candidate
   * the words came from. A typed answer carries no id and is not a lesser
   * answer.
   *
   * Refuses an unknown option rather than recording a dangling id — the card
   * renders the label by looking the id up, so a stale one would render as a
   * blank choice on a decision that reads as answered.
   *
   * `onlyIfUnanswered` makes the write CONDITIONAL on the item still being
   * pending, re-checked here rather than by the caller. Answering twice is
   * legitimate for a person who changed their mind — that is the unconditional
   * default, and the displaced answer becomes history. It is not legitimate for
   * a reply that was folded into an answer only because the item looked open
   * when the request was read: that caller's whole claim is "nobody has
   * answered this", and it must lose the race rather than overwrite the winner.
   * The caller then posts the words as an ordinary comment, which is what they
   * were.

   * reach for when a review is finished — a merged diff review that keeps
   * presenting its unresolved threads forever is the problem it exists to
   * solve. What archiving buys, mechanically:
   *
   *   - `hydrateFromDisk` reads only the TOP LEVEL of the data dir, so an
   *     archived member stops loading at every restart and stops costing a
   *     file poll and a room's worth of memory.
   *   - `activity-backfill` scans `_archive` explicitly, so the `.ydoc` keeps
   *     feeding the Weekly Review analyses. The stream over an archived doc is
   *     byte-identical to the stream before it was archived; that is the
   *     property the suite pins, because it is the whole reason this verb is
   *     not a delete.
   *   - `unarchiveReview` puts it back, so nothing here needs to be right the
   *     first time.
   *
   * Open threads do NOT block it. The guardrail on `deleteWorkspace` exists
   * because deleting strands someone's unread feedback; archiving strands
   * nothing, and a review is usually retired precisely because its remaining
   * threads have stopped mattering.
   *
   * ALL-OR-NOTHING on a docId that is already in `_archive`: rather than write
   * over an older snapshot of the same id — the state a handful of ids on the
   * production box are in, from a hand-move that predates this verb — the
   * whole archive is refused and the colliding ids are named. Unarchive the
   * older copy first, or purge it deliberately; nothing here decides for you

   *   doc → disk — every prose change debounces an 800ms serialize+write
   *   disk → doc — fs.watch fires on external edits, debounced 300ms,
   *     reads the file, diffs against current serialized output, and if
   *     different applies the new markdown in one 'file-watch' transact.
   *   Echo loop is broken by `binding.lastWritten` on both sides — a
   *   write we initiated won't be re-applied, and a read that matches
   *   our cached content is silently ignored.
