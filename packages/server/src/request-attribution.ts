/**
 * ── Request attribution: whose name goes on the write ──
 *
 * The other half of the question `request-admission.ts` answers. Admission
 * decides who the boundary PROVED and whether the request gets in at all;
 * attribution decides which of the things it proved is written down as the
 * author, and what a caller is allowed to claim about itself.
 *
 * ── Why this chains after admission instead of composing beside it ──
 *
 * A14 through A19 came out as factories of long-lived values, composed side
 * by side in `createServer`. This one cannot. Its input is the ADMISSION
 * RESULT — `accessEmail` is what Cloudflare verified for this request, and
 * `visitor` / `visitorShareId` are what the share scope decided — so it has
 * nothing to read until the gate has run. It is a second per-request call
 * taking the first one's output.
 *
 * `AttributableRequest` is that input, and it is deliberately not a shape
 * written out here. It is `Extract<Admission, { admitted: true }>` — the
 * admitted branch itself. Add a field to admission and this module sees it;
 * rename one and this file stops compiling, which is the point. A restated
 * interface would have gone on compiling while the two drifted apart.
 *
 * ── Why the widget-token gate is inside ──
 *
 * It is the one gate here, and it is here because it WRITES the state the
 * rest of the file reads: `widgetIdentity` is resolved once for the whole
 * request and then ranked by `authorFor` at rung 0. Splitting the gate from
 * the ranking would leave the field settable by anything and ranked by this
 * module, which is exactly the arrangement the precedence bug in `authorFor`
 * came out of. An invalid token 401s the whole request, so this call has two
 * outcomes and `Attribution` names them both.
 *
 * ── What is NOT here ──
 *
 * The sign-in write gate stays in `createServer`. It CONSUMES
 * `browserProvedNobody`, it does not produce it, and it guards writes rather
 * than naming authors. It still runs in its old position, below this call
 * and above every route, for the reason its own comment gives.

     * `known-bryan`, and `kind: 'known'` only ever meant "typed a name".

     * verdict outranks whatever the body claims. A caller may still say
     * who they are; they no longer get to say it about someone else.
     *
     * Order matters and each rung has a reason:
     *
     *  1. A proven identity. It outranks the body precisely because the
     *     body is the thing it exists to stop being authoritative — and
     *     it does so whether or not `CW_REQUIRE_EMAIL_AUTH` is on: the
     *     flag governs whether a session is REQUIRED, never whether a
     *     verified one is believed (Bryan, 2026-08-29 — a verified name
     *     is never worse than a typed one).
     *  2. A share visitor with nothing proven stays a `guest-` — that
     *     path is the template this work copies, not a thing it replaces.
     *     Since every share host sits behind Cloudflare Access, a visitor
     *     reaching this rung is a deployment with no verifier wired, not a
     *     normal anonymous reviewer.
     *  3. Otherwise the claimed body, exactly as today. This is the rung
     *     every agent, every MCP call and every un-authenticated browser
     *     lands on, so a request with no session behaves identically
     *     whichever way the flag is set.
     *
     * With no session presented, this function is byte-for-byte what it
     * was whichever way the flag is set.
