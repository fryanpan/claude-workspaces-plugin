/**
 * The effort-estimate scorer's network half: ask Haiku for hands-on and
 * wall-clock seconds from a ticket's title, description and goal.
 *
 * The prompt and the parser are pure and live in
 * `@claude-workspaces/core/effort-estimate-prompt`; this file owns the key, the HTTP
 * call and the timeout — the same split, and largely the same rules, as
 * `review-judge.ts`:
 *
 *  - **The key is the dedicated summary key**, read through `resolveKeyFrom`
 *    with the same Keychain services and the same `CW_SUMMARY_API_KEY`
 *    override. The consent that key represents (2026-08-10) covers
 *    workspace content leaving the machine for a card; a ticket's title and
 *    description going to the same endpoint for the same reason is the same
 *    class of content, so no second key and no second act of consent are
 *    asked for.
 *  - **A caller-visible split between "no estimator" and "no estimate".**
 *    `haikuEffortEstimator` answers `null` — no estimator at all — when
 *    there is no key or scoring is switched off, so `server.ts` can leave a
 *    row untouched exactly as it would if scoring had never been wired in.
 *    A wired estimator's `null` (a timeout, a non-2xx, a reply that will not
 *    parse) is a DIFFERENT thing: an attempt ran and produced nothing
 *    usable, which the caller records as a failed run — unlike the review
 *    gate, an estimate that could not be produced is new information the
 *    row did not have before, never a pass-through.
 *  - **One call per trigger, no retries.** The next edit gets its own
 *    attempt; a failed run is superseded the moment the ticket's words
 *    change again.
 *
 * `createServer` takes the estimator as an option with NO default — the
 * same seam rule as the summarizer and the review judge: nothing that
 * merely spins a server up (every test, every embedded use) can reach the
 * network. `bin.ts` constructs the real one.
