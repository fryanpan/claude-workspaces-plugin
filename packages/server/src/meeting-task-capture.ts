/**
 * Tasks captured from meeting speech: hear "we should file a ticket for
 * that" and the board grows the ticket; hear "we already track that" and the
 * notes link the row that tracks it.
 *
 * WHY THE GUARDS OUTNUMBER THE FEATURE. Everything here feeds links into the
 * composed meeting notes, and a wrong link is worse than no link — it puts
 * the board's authority behind a connection nobody made. So the model's
 * answer is never trusted on its own: a reference must name a candidate the
 * transcript actually mentioned (`tickMentionsCandidate`), a request that
 * duplicates a tracked task becomes a reference to it instead of a twin row
 * (`requestMatchesCandidate`), and anything malformed is dropped in silence.
 * The transcript file remains the durable record either way; a capture pass
 * that misses is a missed convenience, not lost data.
 *
 * SAME CONSENT SEAM AS THE NOTES COMPOSER. The transcript text leaves the
 * machine on this call exactly as it does on the compose call, so the key is
 * the same dedicated one (`resolveKeyFrom`), a generic ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is
 * not honoured, and no key means capture stays off — a settled state the
 * caller logs, not an error.
 *
 * "GO DO IT" IS DELIBERATELY THE BOARD'S OWN PATH. An actionable request is
 * placed in the chores band, transitioned to `todo`, and the lead is woken
 * through the ready-nudge channel — this module never claims `in-progress`
 * itself. The chip in the notes shows live status, so it flips only when the
 * lead's dispatch actually happens, and it stays honest if that never does.
 *
 * THE FILE IS NAMED FOR ITS FIRST TWO INTENTS AND NOW CARRIES SIX. Requests
 * and references were the whole of it; research, lookup and review asks
 * arrived in the same reply rather than in calls of their own, because a
 * tick's prompt is ~95% shared context and what scales with intents is how
 * many times that context is re-sent (decisions.md, 2026-08-30: "One call
 * per tick carries every intent"). An intent added here costs ~58 input
 * tokens; the same intent as its own always-on pass costs seven to
 * twenty-seven times that. So: one call, one items array, a `kind` per
 * intent, and rows that parse independently so one malformed intent never
 * costs the others.
 *
 * A SPOKEN ASK FILES WHAT THE SAME ASK TAPPED WOULD FILE. The pointer pill's
 * Create Task and Research, and the Review float, are the one-or-two-tap
 * forms of three of these intents; the capture pass is the no-tap form, and
 * it goes through the same doors: `parseTaskCreate` with the pill's own body
 * (`spinoffBody`, core) and readiness rule (`readyToWork`, core) for a task;
 * a lead-addressed row plus a placeholder section for research; the Review
 * press's thread for a review ask. What is asked out loud must not land
 * somewhere different from what is asked with a finger — the first version
 * had its own create options and its own gates, and a spoken task that "did
 * nothing" was this path silently scoped to a board a huddle doc never has.
 *
 * A LOOKUP is still the odd one: it only reads, so a wrong one is a link
 * nobody wanted, dropped by the same guards the reference path uses.
 *
 * AND SINCE 2026-09-02, THE SPEAKER SAYS WHICH KIND OF ASK IT IS. "Claude,
 * can you …" is an ask for now — research, lookup, review, acted on while
 * the meeting runs. "create a task …" is an ask for later — a request,
 * captured and not started. Speech using neither phrasing is a note: it
 * reaches the composer like any other words and files nothing. The prompt
 * teaches the convention and `parseTaskCaptureReply` enforces it, so an ask
 * the model finds without a cue is downgraded rather than acted on
 * (`meeting-ask-cues.ts`, Bryan's huddle that day).
 *
 * THE FIFTH INTENT DOES NOT BELONG TO THIS FILE'S SUBJECT AT ALL, AND RIDES
 * HERE ANYWAY. A CORRECTION — "no, I said Thursday" — touches no board row;
 * it fixes a note. It is extracted here for the one reason the decision gives:
 * what a tick pays for is re-sending its context, so an intent that shares the
 * transcript already in the prompt is nearly free, and the same intent as its
 * own pass would pay for the whole prompt again to answer "nothing" on most
 * ticks. So the pass extracts it, checks the half a transcript can vouch for,
 * and hands it on untouched (`CaptureLinks.corrections`) to the module that
 * can finish the job: the notes are in the doc, not here.
