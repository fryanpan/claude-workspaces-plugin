/**
 * Creating a doc over the `/y/` socket is a WRITE, and it is gated like one.
 *
 * The mockup auto-create is the widget's creation path, next to POST
 * /api/docs and the MCP tools. It used to run ABOVE the socket's read-only
 * decision, so a browser that had proven nobody could open
 * `/y/<any-new-id>?type=mockup` and make the server create a doc and file a
 * new row under the board workspace — the read-only carry only stopped the ydoc
 * edits that came afterwards, never the creation itself.
 *
 * Refusing here gates no READ: the doc the socket would have created does not
 * exist for anybody, so there is nothing this refusal keeps a reader from.
 * The pair of tests below is the whole point — the same socket, byte for
 * byte, against a server with the flag off, which must create the doc.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
