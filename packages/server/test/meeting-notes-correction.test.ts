/**
 * Correcting a note out loud: which note the words resolve to, what happens

 * never cross — a note a person wrote is proposed on, never overwritten.
 *
 * The integration half runs the REAL notes-doc path — `applyNotesUpdate` to
 * write notes and stock the ownership ledger, `applyNotesCorrection` to
 * correct them — rather than a stub that agrees with everything. A recorder
 * that says ok to every call cannot tell a correction that landed from one
 * that did nothing (the #512 lesson), and the whole feature is about which of
 * those happened.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
