/**
 * Withdrawing a review item raised on a DOC THREAD.
 *
 * The second half of the failure `doc-thread-revise.test.ts` covers, and the
 * half that actually stranded someone. An agent that corrects itself by
 * filing a SECOND item — which is what it had to do before revision existed,
 * and what an agent working a thread it does not own may still do — ends up
 * with two asks on one thread. It then cannot clean up: `/answer` invents a
 * reply the reader never gave, and `/resolve` is thread-scoped and takes the
 * live ask down with the stale one.
 *
 * Measured before building this (2026-08-30), against a real server:
 *
 *   - two declarations on ONE thread → the queue shows ONE row, the newest;
 *     the older is invisible on Home but still renders in the doc
 *   - resolving that thread → both gone
 *   - answering the newest → the older, never-answered ask is gone for good
 *
 * So the fix is not a second visibility model for threads. It is a third
 * exit — the asker takes its own ask back, the thread stays open, and
 * `pendingDeclaration` falls through to whatever is still standing.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the jordan@partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.
