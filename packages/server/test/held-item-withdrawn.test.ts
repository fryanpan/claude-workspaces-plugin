/**
 * A withdrawn ask leaves the held index — the whole path, from the store that
 * holds the row to the frames the nudger sends.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG. `withdrawReview` keeps the standing verdict on purpose: a
 * reinstated item the gate held is still held, so the stamp has to survive the
 * round trip. `isReviewItemHeld` read that verdict and the wrapper's `answer`
 * and nothing else, so an item its asker took back kept answering "held"
 * forever — and nothing could ever clear it, because `revise_review_item`
 * refuses a withdrawn item and answering it is the reader's door, which a
 * withdrawal is the act of closing. A peer lead measured the cost: a
 * `workspace.review_item_held` at the filer every few minutes for hours after
 * the withdrawal, and the same items named inside every `workspace.stalled`
 * frame.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A UNIT TEST ON THE PREDICATE. The predicate
 * has one in `review-item.test.ts`. What that cannot show is that the FRAMES
 * stop, and the frames are what the peer was reading — three layers sit
 * between the verdict and the wake (`heldReviewItems` builds the list,
 * `overdueHeldItems` ages it, `StallNudger` addresses it), and each is free to
 * reintroduce the row. So the composition is assembled here exactly as
 * `server.ts` assembles it, and the assertions are about what arrives.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented ids and generic personas. The repo is
 * public.
