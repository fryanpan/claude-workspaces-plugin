/**
 * A group bind lands on a board too — as ONE unit.
 *
 * PR #127 made every STANDALONE doc land in a board workspace and deliberately
 * left group binds alone, so a diff review or folder bind was reachable only
 * by its URL: nothing on any board pointed at it. This closes that path.
 *
 * The modelling decision these tests encode, because it is the whole reason
 * this is separate work — two different things wear the word "workspace":
 *
 *   - a GROUPING id (`meta.workspaceId`, a.k.a. `reviewId`) bundles the member
 *     docs of one folder bind or diff review. It has no live doc of its own.
 *   - a BOARD workspace is the board: goals, tasks, and a list of attached ids.
 *
 * A board's `docIds` is a list of ATTACHMENT ids, and an attachment is either
 * a live doc or a grouping — `POST /workspaces/:id/docs` has accepted both
 * since it was written, and the board sidebar already resolves a grouping id
 * through the workspace endpoints. So the unit that goes on the board is the
 * grouping, and its members stay off: a hundred-file review is one row, not a
 * hundred.
 *
 * Route-level on purpose. Every REST handler here hand-copies body fields into
 * the doc-store call and nothing type-checks that layer.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
