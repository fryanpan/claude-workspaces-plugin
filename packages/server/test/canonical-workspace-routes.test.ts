/**
 * The two board collections that now live at `/workspaces/<id>/…`, and the
 * proof that the addresses they left are gone.
 *
 * These are the route inventory's step-2 collisions: the agent roster sat on
 * `attachments`, which the glossary spends on docs, mockups, previews and
 * diffs, and the board's live feed sat at `/events/workspace/<id>`, which put
 * the workspace in a segment the guard could not read AND spelled the stream
 * `events` — the activity feed's name. Both moved under the workspace that
 * owns them, and neither old address is answered: no redirect, no alias.
 *
 * What each test is actually for:
 *
 *  - The OLD path 404s. A rename nobody can see is a rename that did not
 *    happen — a route left answering both spellings is the dual-prefix alias
 *    this cutover exists to remove, and it would keep every caller on the old
 *    name until something else broke.
 *  - The NEW path does what the old one did, verb by verb, so the move is a
 *    rename rather than a rewrite.
 *  - A FOREIGN workspace id is refused on both collections. The whole point
 *    of putting the workspace in the path is that the id in the path is the
 *    one the answer is scoped to; a route that ignores it has moved its
 *    address and kept its bug.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented board and agent names. The repo is
 * public.
