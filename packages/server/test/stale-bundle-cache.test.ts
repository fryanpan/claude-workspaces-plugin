/**
 * A reload cannot return the bundle the tab is already running.
 *
 * Reported by Bryan on an iPad: "New version available" appeared, he tapped
 * Reload, and the banner came straight back. The banner was right. The tab
 * really was still on the old build after the reload, and the reason is that
 * nothing the server sent could make it otherwise: every entry bundle lived at
 * a PERMANENT url (`/app/board.js`), so whether a reload picked up new bytes was
 * a decision only the browser's cache made. `Cache-Control: no-cache` asks for
 * revalidation; it does not compel it. And the shell naming those urls went
 * out with no cache directives and no validator at all, which makes it
 * heuristically cacheable — the browser picks its own freshness lifetime for
 * the one document that decides which bundles the page loads.
 *
 * The fix removes the browser from the decision, and this suite is that chain
 * in four links:
 *
 *   1. the shell is `no-store`, so a reload always re-fetches it;
 *   2. every asset the shell names is content-addressed;
 *   3. changing an asset changes the url the shell names;
 *   4. so after a deploy the reload asks for urls no cache has ever held.
 *
 * Link 3 is the one that carries the others. A test that only checked for a
 * hash-shaped filename would pass against a build that stamped the same hash
 * forever, so the assertions below compare the url BEFORE and AFTER a
 * simulated redeploy rather than matching a shape.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
