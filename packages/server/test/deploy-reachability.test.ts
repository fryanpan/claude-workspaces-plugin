/**
 * Who can trigger a deploy?
 *
 * The plugin refresh next door is safe to expose widely because it cannot
 * interrupt anybody — it rewrites a version-keyed cache and every running
 * session keeps loading the path it resolved at launch. **A deploy does not
 * inherit that argument.** It restarts this process, which drops every live
 * editor websocket and every SSE stream on the box. So the reachability
 * question has to be asked again from scratch rather than copied from the
 * route above it.
 *
 * Three layers, because each one is the only thing that catches its class:
 *
 * 1. `shareScopeAllows` — a share visitor never reaches the route at all.
 *    Pinned here because "closed by default" is a property of a file somebody
 *    can edit, and the allowlist has been widened before.
 * 2. `isLoopbackAddress` — the PEER address, not the Host header. Measured
 *    2026-08-17 against a real `Bun.serve`: a client on an RFC1918 LAN
 *    address and one on a CGNAT tailnet address both connected while sending
 *    `Host: localhost:1`, were classified local by the Host guard, and were
 *    reported by `server.requestIP()` at their true addresses. A Host-based
 *    loopback check would therefore have been spoofable by exactly the
 *    callers it was meant to exclude. (Addresses in the cases below are
 *    synthetic — this is a public repo and the range is what matters.)
 * 3. The route, end to end, over a real socket from a real address.
 *
 * Every test that asserts a refusal asserts a permission first, on the same
 * fixture in the same pass.
