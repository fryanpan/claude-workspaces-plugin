/**
 * Triage shapes a captured row — and never at the cost of the capture.
 *
 * Quick-capture is deliberately dumb: one row per submit, the first line
 * clipped for a title, the whole utterance kept as the body, no network and no
 * judgement. That is correct and is not what this file tests. What it tests is
 * the step AFTER — the one that turns that row into work — and the two things
 * that step is not allowed to cost:
 *
 *  1. the raw row must land and survive exactly as it does today when nothing
 *     shapes it (no attached agent, or an agent that never gets round to it);
 *  2. a rewrite must never be the only record of what was said.
 *
 * Every assertion of an absence here has a peer on the same page that shows
 * the probe can see a presence — the "raw row unchanged" case is run against
 * the SAME server that then shapes the same row through the real route, so
 * "unchanged" cannot be an artefact of nothing being able to change it.
 *
 * Fixtures are synthetic — invented product names, invented agent names. The
 * repo is public.
