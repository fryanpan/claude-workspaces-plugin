/**
 * The `decision.answered` channel line, fed the rows the SERVER actually
 * writes rather than hand-written fixtures.
 *
 * Same lesson as `activity-lines.test.ts`: a renderer test that invents its
 * own payload proves the switch has a case for the event, never that the keys
 * it reads are the keys the store emits. The clause under test here is about
 * one of those keys — `links` — so a fixture would be exactly the wrong
 * evidence.
 *
 * `events.jsonl` is the read-back surface because `appendAudit` writes the
 * SSE payload byte-for-byte (`event` key, not `type`), so the row the log
 * holds is the frame the plugin's renderer receives.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
