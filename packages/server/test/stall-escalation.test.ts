/**
 * The board going over its lead's head.
 *
 * The gap: `stall-nudge.ts` wakes the lead and stops, so a board whose lead
 * has died, run out of quota, or is itself waiting on somebody keeps being
 * told about rows nobody can act on, and no person ever hears. This suite
 * drives `StallEscalations` directly against a real `TaskStore`, because the
 * thing under test is what lands on a reader's queue — one item, revised as
 * the set moves, withdrawn when it empties, and never a second one.
 *
 * Every clock is passed in (`now`) rather than waited for: the module takes
 * the tick's time as an argument, so an hour is a number here and no test
 * sleeps. The one clock that is real is the STORE's — `addReviewItem` stamps
 * `updatedAt` itself — which is exactly why the record keeps the write's own
 * timestamp rather than the tick's.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names. The repo is public.
