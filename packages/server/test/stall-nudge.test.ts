/**
 * The board telling its lead that work has stopped.
 *
 * What is under test is almost entirely the FRUGALITY, the same way it is for
 * `ready-nudge.ts`: a wake costs the lead a turn, and one that repeats every
 * minute over a row that has not changed teaches them to skim wakes — and
 * then the one that mattered is skimmed too. So most of what is asserted here
 * is silence.
 *
 * The one place this deliberately differs from the ready-work wake is
 * escalation: a row that stays stalled is worth saying again eventually,
 * because unlike ready work it names something that was supposed to be
 * moving. That is the repeat window, and it is asserted here as a bounded
 * thing rather than as a cooldown that fires forever.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented titles in a made-up workspace. The
 * repo is public.
