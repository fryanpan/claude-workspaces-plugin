/**
 * A scripted meeting with ten planted references, run through the real tick
 * pipeline.
 *
 * WHY A WHOLE MEETING AND NOT TEN CALLS TO THE MATCHER. The unit tests next
 * door (`notes-link-intent.test.ts`) pin the decision; this pins the DELIVERY.
 * Between the decision and the note sit the catalogue assembly, the strict
 * matcher's first refusal, the compose input, the speaker-tag check, the
 * suggestion append and the Yjs merge — and the owner's report was not "the
 * scoring is wrong", it was that asking for a link did nothing. Only the
 * whole chain can answer that.
 *
 * HOW THE FIXTURE WAS WRITTEN, because it decides whether the tally means
 * anything. The board was written FIRST, as ten ordinary tickets with the
 * bodies somebody filing them would write. The speech was written after, as a
 * person talking: a name, an anecdote, and the subject described rather than
 * named. Where a spoken word also appears in a ticket body it is because a
 * ticket about a cracked belt clip says "clip" — not because the sentence was
 * tuned until it passed. Two of the ten share no word at all with their row's
 * title, and most of the rest share exactly one.
 *
 * THE HONEST MEASURE OF WHAT THIS ADDS: run the same ten past the strict
 * matcher alone and it cites ONE of them, because one shared title word can
 * never make the run of two `namesReference` demands. That is the gap the
 * owner was reporting, in a number.
 *
 * AND THE CONTROLS ARE THE OTHER HALF. Four more ticks ask for a link to work
 * this board does not hold, or talk about the board's subjects without asking
 * for anything. A pass that links ten of ten and also links those four is a
 * matcher that says yes to everything, and the tally alone would not show it.
 * Every fixture name is invented; the repo is public.
