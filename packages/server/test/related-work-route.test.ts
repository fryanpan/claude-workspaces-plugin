/**
 * `GET /workspaces/:id/related-work` — the matching step over a real board.
 *
 * The scorer itself is unit-tested in `packages/core/src/related-work.test.ts`;
 * what this suite is for is everything the route decides and the scorer cannot
 * see: which goals and which docs become candidates, that the request's own
 * doc never matches itself, and that a link a goal already carries surfaces
 * work whose words share nothing with the ask.
 *
 * The board is built the way the incident's board was: two goals, one plan doc
 * that covers the first goal, and the huddle notes the request came out of.
 *
 * Every negative assertion here is paired with `considered`, which is how many
 * rows the route weighed. An empty `matches` beside a zero `considered` would
 * mean the board was empty and the route proved nothing — the positive control
 * that keeps "returns nothing" from passing vacuously.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
