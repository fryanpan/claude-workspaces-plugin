/**
 * The premise-drift signal, driven through the REAL work-queue route.
 *
 * task-staleness.test.ts proves the arming rule. It cannot prove the notes
 * survive the trip from the task's body doc, through the projection, into
 * `buildQueue`, and out of `GET /workspaces/:id/next` — and that trip is
 * where this class of bug lives here: every REST handler hand-copies fields,
 * and the route is the layer nothing type-checks. `groups` was accepted,
 * returned ok:true, and discarded exactly this way.
 *
 * It also pins the thing that made the whole feature necessary: the queue row
 * used to carry `body` and drop the discussion, so a correction a previous
 * reader had already written sat one API call away from every agent that
 * re-derived it from scratch.
 *
 * Fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
