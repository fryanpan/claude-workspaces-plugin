/**
 * DELETE /workspaces/:id, for a BOARD workspace.
 *
 * The route existed and did not cover boards at all: `deleteWorkspace` starts
 * from `docStore.list().filter(m => m.workspaceId === id)`, and a board has no
 * doc members — boards live in `TaskStore` — so every call hit
 * `members.length === 0` and returned `not-found`. A board made for a
 * five-minute experiment was permanent.
 *
 * A board's footprint is bigger than its map entry, and each piece left behind
 * fails differently: the tasks sidecar RESURRECTS the board on restart; the
 * events log is the audit trail of a board nobody can see; the `ws:<id>` doc
 * keeps the board URL loading with stale content; `task:<id>` docs are one
 * orphan Yjs doc per task, forever; and the taskIndex resolves task ids to a
 * workspace that is gone.
 *
 * The one thing deletion must NOT touch is linked docs. `attachDoc` is a LINK;
 * a doc attached to a board stays readable through any OTHER board citing it.
 *
 * Fixtures are synthetic — the jordan@partner.example register. Public repo.
