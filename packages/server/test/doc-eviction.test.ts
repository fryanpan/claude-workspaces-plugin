/**
 * Eviction is where this feature can lose Bryan's work, so these tests are
 * about the four named ways it does that — not about whether memory went
 * down.
 *
 * The one that matters most is the last: a bound doc evicted while an edit is
 * still inside its debounce window, then edited on disk by someone else, must
 * end up with BOTH edits. Every other guard exists so that cannot happen by a
 * different route.
 *
 * Two days is Bryan's number ("drop idle docs after two days, but if the user
 * opens the doc again or interacts with it that resets the clock"), so these
 * drive an injected clock rather than waiting, and reset it through the real
 * `get` rather than by writing to the map behind it.
