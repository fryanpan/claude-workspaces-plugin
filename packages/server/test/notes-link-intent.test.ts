/**
 * The loose matcher: what a spoken "link that to the existing task" reaches
 * for, and what it refuses to guess at.
 *
 * The strict matcher next door (`notes-references.test.ts`) pins the opposite
 * bar — an unprompted citation needs the title's own words. Everything here
 * is about the case that one is deliberately bad at: an instruction, given
 * with a description rather than a name.
 *
 * The board below is invented, and its rows carry bodies the way real rows
 * do. The bodies matter to the answer, so they are written the way somebody
 * filing the ticket would write them — never as a restatement of the speech
 * the test then feeds in. Where a row has no body at all it is there to prove
 * the title alone still reaches.
