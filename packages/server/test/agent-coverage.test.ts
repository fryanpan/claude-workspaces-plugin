/**
 * Can an agent tell deafness from silence — from the inside?
 *
 * The measured incident: a peer held six docs under `watch_doc` and believed
 * it was listening. It had never called `attach_agent` on the board those
 * docs live on. Spoken changes queued SILENTLY, and every probe the agent
 * could run answered confidently: `list_watched_docs` said six watches, all
 * live. Six watches IS the true answer to the question that probe asks. It is
 * the wrong question.
 *
 * So `GET /api/agents/:id/watches` grows a `coverage` block that answers the
 * question the agent actually has: not "what am I watching" but "what am I
 * MISSING". `unattachedBoards` is that incident rendered as a row — six docs
 * watched, zero attachments, items waiting for a lead that is not there.
 *
 * Every absence assertion here sits beside a positive control in the same
 * read, because "no row" and "a probe that cannot see" are the two things
 * this whole ticket exists to tell apart.
 *
 * Reading coverage must never DRAIN a queue. A read that delivered would
 * reintroduce the bug one layer down: the counts would be right once and the
 * items would be gone, with the attach that was supposed to receive them
 * finding nothing and nobody able to say why. Asserted explicitly below.
 *
 * All fixtures synthetic. No port is bound (port: 0); no production server is
 * touched.
