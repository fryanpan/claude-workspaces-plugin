/**
 * One notes section ACROSS A RESTART.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS PINS. The section a tick extends is the one the ownership
 * ledger says this note-taker wrote; a section it claims nothing in falls back
 * to the position test, and that test fails the moment anything is appended
 * below the notes — a Research placeholder, a heading a person typed. The
 * ledger lived only in memory, so a deploy mid-meeting emptied it and the very
 * next tick opened a SECOND "Meeting notes": the twinning #637 fixed, back
 * again for as long as the process is young. Deploys happen mid-meeting.
 *
 * The restart is modelled the way one really happens: the doc comes back from
 * its markdown, the process's ledger is new, and the recording is a NEW
 * meeting — the browser says "the connection to the meeting was lost" and the
 * person presses record again, which mints a new meeting id. That is why the
 * claim cannot be keyed to the meeting id alone.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
