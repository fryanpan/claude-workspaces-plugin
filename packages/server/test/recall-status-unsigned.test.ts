/**
 * `POST /recall/status` is armed only while its credential is configured —
 * on EVERY host, not just the dedicated callback one.
 *
 * `recallCallbackAllows` already closed this path on the callback hostname
 * when `RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unset, and its header says why: unset used
 * to mean "accept unsigned bodies". But the route is reachable on every other
 * admitting host class too, and there the whole signature-and-replay block
 * sat inside `if (secret)`. So on a server with no secret — which is the
 * DEFAULT; the boot warns rather than refuses — an unauthenticated non-browser
 * caller on the LAN or the tailnet could inject arbitrary bot-status and
 * calendar-sync events, unsigned and unbounded by the replay guard.
 *
 * The positive control is the same body against a server that HAS a secret:
 * signed it is accepted, unsigned it is a `bad signature`. Without that pair,
 * the 404 below could be a route that does not exist at all.
 *
 * Every credential here is a literal this suite invents. Fixtures are
 * synthetic; the repo is public.
