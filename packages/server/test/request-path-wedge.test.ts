/**
 * Every way a REQUEST can name a doc, against a file that never answers.
 *
 * `hydrate-wedge.test.ts` proves the shape on two routes. This file is the
 * enumeration: each address the server accepts for a doc gets its own pass,
 * and after each one an unrelated route has to still answer. The point is not
 * that any single route is safe — it is that no route is special, because the
 * guarantee lives below all of them. A hydrate that has no bytes in hand
 * defers to the thread pool and parks the doc (`DocStore.prereadFor`), so the
 * main thread is never the thing waiting on the file.
 *
 * ON "THE HEALTH ROUTE". There is no `/health` endpoint on this server, and
 * the supervisor's own check is a TCP connect (`probePortListening` in
 * `scripts/serve.ts`) which a wedged-but-listening process would still pass —
 * the kernel completes the handshake whether or not the event loop is alive.
 * So the liveness question has to be asked with a real HTTP request, and
 * `GET /api/metrics` is the one that asks it most cleanly: it sits above the
 * doc routes in the chain, hydrates nothing, and cannot answer unless the
 * event loop is free.
 *
 * A FIFO with no writer is the failing file: `stat` answers, `open` blocks
 * until somebody opens the other end, and nobody here ever does.
 *
 * The board, the doc and the paths here are invented.
