/**
 * Triage for the threads the old inferred review queue left behind.
 *
 * Two layers, and the second is not optional. The classifier is pure and gets
 * hand-built threads. But the thing that decides whether the SCRIPT works is
 * whether the queue endpoint's field names and the reader's agree, and whether
 * a resolve actually takes a row off the queue — neither of which a unit test
 * over fixtures can see. So the last describe drives the real routes on a real
 * in-process server and reads the effect back.
 *
 * Every fixture is synthetic — invented names, invented copy. The repo is
 * public.
