   * The loop, over a board that HAS goals — and specifically one band nobody

   *
   * A band in triage dispatches nothing under it, so a row sitting there is
   * idle BY RULE and naming it as stalled would tell the lead to go and drive
   * work the board has not decided to do. It is not judged at all — it leaves
   * the denominator too, so the count below is the agreed row alone. The
   * band's status lives on the goal ROWS; the ordered goal list carries none,
   * so this is the one path that proves the snapshot goes and reads them.
   *
   * The control row is moved into the AGREED band rather than left without
   * one: on a board that has bands, a row with no goal is formal backlog and
   * would be withheld too, so a silent pass over it would prove nothing about
   * triage in particular.
