/**
 * What the quality gate does when the judge cannot answer, and what a crash
 * mid-judge leaves on disk.
 *
 * Both are about the same rule: fail-open is for an item nobody has judged,
 * never for one already held. A failure that admitted a held item made every
 * hold clearable by revising until a call timed out, and a recovery that
 * dropped the hold history reset the cap the loop fix depends on.
 *
 * The judge is a STUB throughout; all fixtures are invented.
