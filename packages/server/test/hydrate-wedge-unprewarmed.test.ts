/**
 * The doors into hydration that the per-request prewarm does not cover.
 *
 * `server.ts` prewarms every docId it can read out of the request URL, so the
 * routes addressed as `/events/<id>` or `/api/docs/<id>` reach a synchronous
 * hydrate with the bytes already in hand. `hydrate-wedge.test.ts` covers those.
 *
 * Three ways in are left, and each one reaches `attachFile` with no preread at
 * all — which on the pre-fix code meant `readFileSync` on the main thread:
 *
 *   - A docId that arrives in the request BODY rather than the URL.
 *     `POST /api/docs` re-binding an existing doc is the shape measured at
 *     328 s on production.
 *   - A route that FANS OUT over a board's docIds. `listThreads` is called
 *     for every doc on the board by the home queue (`home-pane.ts`), the
 *     workspace listing (`doc-store-workspaces.ts`) and the archive route; none
 *     of those ids is in the URL, so none of them is prewarmed.
 *   - A background TIMER. The stall scan walks the same docIds on its own
 *     clock with no request anywhere, so there is nothing to prewarm it.
 *
 * A FIFO with no writer reproduces the sick file provider exactly: `stat`
 * answers, `open` blocks until somebody opens the other end, and nobody here
 * ever does. The doc, the paths and the content are invented.
