/**
 * Shutdown waits for the meetings its own socket-close started.
 *
 * A server shutdown force-closes every connection (see
 * `server-stop-closes-sockets.test.ts` for why it has to), and Bun runs each
 * `close(ws)` handler synchronously inside that call. The relay's handler
 * cannot await — it is a callback — so it starts the teardown and returns,
 * and that teardown is where a meeting's last sentence is flushed out of the
 * engine and into the doc.
 *
 * The shutdown flushes the docs immediately afterwards. If `dispose()` did
 * not wait for those teardowns, the flush would run first and the final notes
 * would be written into a doc nothing will ever save again — lost silently,
 * on every meeting that was live when the server went down.
