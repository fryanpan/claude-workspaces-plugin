/**
 * A delivery to a LIVE agent has to be durable too.
 *
 * `voice-gate-liveness.test.ts` and `agent-stream-liveness.test.ts` both fixed
 * the same half of this: making the server's answer to "is this agent
 * reachable" correct. Neither touched what happens once the answer is yes.
 *
 * On the yes branch the route emitted one SSE frame and kept no record:
 *
 *     if (hasLiveAttachment(ws)) result = { route: 'agent', ack: 'Sent…' }
 *     else { queueVoiceRequest(…);  result = { route: 'agent-queued', … } }
 *
 * So being live made a message strictly LESS likely to arrive than being away,
 * which is the reverse of what liveness should buy. Measured 2026-08-19: of ten
 * utterances that day, nine took `agent-queued` or `fast-path` and survived;
 * the one that took `agent` is the one that was lost, and `attach_agent` four
 * minutes later returned `queuedVoice: []` because it had never been written
 * anywhere.
 *
 * The fix inverts the relationship the ticket names: the queue is the record
 * and live delivery is an optimisation on top of it. Every utterance routed to
 * an agent is written down; the frame is sent as well when someone is there;
 * and the entry leaves the queue when the receiving process ACKNOWLEDGES it,
 * not when the server finishes writing to a socket.
 *
 * The grace window is what stops that durability turning into duplicate work.
 * A frame in flight has been emitted and not yet acked, which is
 * indistinguishable from one that was lost — so a redelivery has to wait long
 * enough for a working agent to have acked, and an attaching agent (a NEW
 * process, for which nothing can be in flight) skips the wait entirely.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
