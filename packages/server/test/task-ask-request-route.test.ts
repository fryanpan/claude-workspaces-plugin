/**
 * The board's Plan / Review controls, server side.
 *
 * A ticket's comments live in its body doc (`task:<id>`), so the task panel's
 * two controls press the SAME routes the meeting floats press —
 * `POST /api/docs/task:<id>/plan-request` and `.../review-request`. That is
 * the whole point: the ask is an ordinary subject thread from the presser on
 * the ticket's own doc, so the seated lead hears it on the board
 * subscription it already holds, with no new event type and no new route.
 *
 * What this pins is the two halves the panel depends on:
 *   - the ask lands as a thread on the TICKET, from the presser; and
 *   - the doc is stamped with who asked and when, which is the only place
 *     the receipt ("Plan requested by Jordan") can come from after a reload.
 *
 * Plus the words: a ticket's ask must not tell the agent to append a plan to
 * "this doc" and file the first tickets from it — that text is the huddle
 * doc's, and on a ticket it names the ticket's own description and asks for
 * tickets from a ticket.
 *
 * All fixtures synthetic; no port is bound (port: 0). The repo is public.
