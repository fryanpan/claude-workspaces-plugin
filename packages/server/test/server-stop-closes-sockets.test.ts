/**
 * `handle.stop()` closes the connections it already has, not just the door.
 *
 * Bun's `server.stop()` stops ACCEPTING and leaves every open connection
 * alive — keep-alive HTTP and websockets both. This server starts and stops
 * hundreds of times in a test run, and each stop used to leave its sockets
 * behind: measured 2026-08-30, +733 kernel PCBs per run of the server suite
 * (`sysctl -n net.inet.tcp.pcbcount`, before/after, against a +2 idle control
 * over the same 260s). A night of parallel runs took the whole machine to
 * ENOBUFS — every process on the box refused a socket for 4.5 hours, and only
 * a reboot cleared it.
 *
 * So what is asserted here is the CONNECTION, not the listener. A test that
 * only checked "a new request is refused after stop" passes on the leaking
 * build, because refusing new connections is exactly the half `stop()` did.
