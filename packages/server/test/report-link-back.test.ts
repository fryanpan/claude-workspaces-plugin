/**
 * Posting a report hands back the link to where it landed.
 *
 * The measured problem this serves, from one 38-hour window on this
 * project's own board: 52,340 words — 40% of every word in the owner's chat
 * window — were agent-to-agent reports relayed through his terminal. Ninety-
 * nine of them, two single messages at 3,079 and 4,392 words, none addressed
 * to him. Each had an obvious correct home: the thread that asked.
 *
 * The rule telling agents to post there already ships, and did not prevent
 * it. Part of the reason is friction on the honest path: an agent that DOES
 * post its report then has to hand its peer a pointer, and the response it
 * just got back contained no link. It had to assemble the URL from parts
 * against a base it may not know — while replying in chat cost nothing. So
 * the cheap path was the wrong one.
 *
 * This closes that gap the way `reviewGapAdvice` closes its own: the thing
 * the author needs travels back on the success response. No new endpoint and
 * no second URL contract — `externalBaseUrl()` already exists precisely so an
 * operator override cannot reach some links and miss others, `taskDeepLink()`
 * owns the task path's shape, and `withReviewUrl` owns the doc path's.
 *
 * BOTH surfaces are covered on purpose. The thread that asked you for
 * something is very often a comment on a markdown attachment rather than a
 * task, so a version answering only for `task:` docs would hand back nothing
 * on the commonest reply path.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
