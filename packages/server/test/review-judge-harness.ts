 * Extracted because two suites drive the same server — the loop itself and
 * what happens when the judge cannot answer — and a fixture copied into both
 * is a fixture that drifts in one.
 *
 * The judge is a STUB throughout; the real API is never called. All fixtures
 * are invented, because the repo is public.
