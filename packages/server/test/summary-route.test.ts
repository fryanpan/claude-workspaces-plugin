/**
 * POST /api/docs/:docId/threads/:threadId/summary, over real HTTP.
 *
 * This file exists because of a failure mode this repo has hit before: a route
 * hand-copies fields between the HTTP body and the doc-store call, so a value can
 * be accepted, answered with 200, and silently dropped — and a unit test that
 * calls `docStore.applyThreadSummary` directly never sees it. Everything here
 * therefore goes through `fetch` against a real `createServer({ port: 0 })`,
 * and every claim about what got stored is re-read with a fresh GET rather
 * than taken from the POST's own response body.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE TOUCHES THE NETWORK. The summarizer is injected with a stub
 * `fetch` and a literal test key, so the suite neither reaches
 * api.anthropic.com nor depends on whether the machine running it happens to
 * have a key in its Keychain. `calls` is asserted on directly: "no summary was
 * generated" is only meaningful if we can also show the stub gets called when
 * generation IS on.
