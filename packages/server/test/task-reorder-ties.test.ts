/**
 * Dropping a row between two rows that share an `order`.
 *
 * `order` is fractional and nothing has ever guaranteed it is DISTINCT within
 * a goal — `createTask` and `setTaskGoal` both store whatever number the
 * caller sends, so two agents that each say `1` tie. The board sorts by
 * `(order, createdAt, id)`, so between two tied rows there is no order value
 * at all: any number greater than the first is also greater than the second,
 * and the createdAt tiebreak decides where the row actually lands. A drop
 * there cannot be expressed as a number, which is why the placement also
 * takes `after` — the id of the row the dragged row should land behind.
 *
 * An id rather than an INDEX because the two ends count different rows: the
 * board's list is filtered (done window, "mine" tab) and the server's is not,
 * so an index would mean two different things at the two ends of the request.
 *
 * Measured on a real board before this was written: 5 of the 12 visible rows
 * in one goal shared an order with a neighbour, and 14% of the drops that
 * board could express landed somewhere other than where the pointer put them.
 *
 * Fixtures are synthetic — invented names, the repo is public.
