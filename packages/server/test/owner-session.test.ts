/**
 * Joining a task's OWNER to the session that did the work.
 *
 * A task records its owner as a display name (`Search Revamp`); an attachment
 * records an identity id (`agent-search-revamp`, or whatever the attaching
 * session passed). `attachedAgentTest` already reconciles the two — but it
 * answers only yes/no, so the board can say what an owner IS and still not
 * say when that session was last seen. This is the reader that returns the
 * MATCHING attachment rather than a boolean.
 *
 * Two things under test that are easy to get wrong and expensive to get
 * wrong:
 *
 *  - The reserved owners (`agent`, `human`) must resolve to NO session. They
 *    are shared or unnamed by construction — measured on the live board, one
 *    generic identity carried 858 activity events across multiple distinct
 *    sessions — so a join on them attributes one session's work to another.
 *    Silence is the correct answer; a confident wrong name is not.
 *  - `endpoint` is a host-machine field and must never ride along. The
 *    session payload names its fields one at a time instead of spreading the
 *    attachment, and the route test asserts the endpoint's absence on the RAW
 *    body. That assertion is not decorative: swapping the allow-list for a
 *    spread was measured putting the endpoint on every agent-owned row of the
 *    board read, and this is the test that caught it.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the jordan@partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.
