/**
 * Malformed percent-escapes in a path.
 *
 * What has to hold, and what each check would fail on:
 *
 *  - A BAD ESCAPE IS THE CALLER'S ERROR, NOT THE SERVER'S. `a%zzb` answers
 *    400. Before the front-door guard, two shapes answered 500 with a
 *    `URIError` thrown inside the route that decoded the segment — the board
 *    page and one prompt. Remove the guard and both go back to 500.
 *  - THE GUARD IS NOT A BLANKET REFUSAL. A legitimately encoded `%` (`%25`)
 *    and ordinary ids still route normally. Reject on the presence of `%`
 *    rather than on whether it decodes, and these controls fail.
 *  - IT COVERS ROUTES NOBODY CONVERTED. The two 500s were in different
 *    modules that each decode directly; the check sits ahead of both rather
 *    than inside either, so a route added later is covered without being
 *    changed.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
