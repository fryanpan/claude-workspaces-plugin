/**
 * A document that holds content must have an address.
 *
 * 46 live documents on prod are addressable by no URL at all. The diagnosis
 * (2026-09-06) found no live leak — 36 of them pre-date boards entirely and
 * 10 are the fallout of two boards removed by hand — but nothing in the suite
 * would have NOTICED a leak, which is the reason those 46 accumulated in
 * silence for three months rather than reddening a build the first week.
 *
 * So this file is the alarm rather than a fix. It drives the ways a document
 * is born on a board, then asks the server for every live document's address
 * and fails on any that holds content and has none.
 *
 * "Address" is the server's own answer, not a rule restated here: the board
 * listing decorates each row with `reviewUrl`, which `withReviewUrl` mints
 * from the board holding the doc and omits when no board does. Asking the
 * routes rather than the membership helpers is deliberate — a helper that
 * agreed with a broken listing would let this pass while the doc stayed
 * unreachable in a browser.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
