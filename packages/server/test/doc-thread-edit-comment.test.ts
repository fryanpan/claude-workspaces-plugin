/**
 * Replacing the words of a comment that is already posted.
 *
 * The absence this covers was measured, not imagined. The canonical-routes
 * cutover retired `/review/<docId>`, and months of comments across every board
 * carry inline links in that shape. They do not 404 — `parseWorkspaceLink` no
 * longer recognises the shape at all, so they degrade to plain text, and
 * nobody reports plain text. A sweep found 77 such links on one board and
 * could repair 18: comment bodies were unreachable, because no operation on
 * this server changed a posted comment's text.
 *
 * Two things have to hold, and each has its own test. The old words survive —
 * a comment is somebody's writing and this project soft-deletes — and nothing
 * else about the comment moves, because an edit corrects what a comment SAYS
 * and must not quietly restate who asked, when, or what they asked for.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the jordan@partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.
