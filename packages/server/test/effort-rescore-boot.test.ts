/**
 * What a PROMPT BUMP does to a board that is already full of estimates.
 *
 * Scoring is event-driven — create, retitle, body edit, re-triage — and a
 * change to the prompt is none of those. So `EFFORT_ESTIMATE_PROMPT_VERSION`
 * exists to make staleness decidable, and the boot pass is the thing that
 * acts on it: without one, a new ask reaches only the tickets somebody
 * happens to edit afterwards and the board forecasts indefinitely from
 * answers to a question nobody is asking any more.
 *
 * Two halves, and they fail independently:
 *  - the right rows get re-scored (open ones, never closed ones, and the
 *    never-scored ones too), and
 *  - the answer REACHES THE BOARD. `recordEffortEstimate` is deliberately
 *    quiet — no store event, or the write would re-trigger its own scorer
 *    forever — and the ydoc projection refreshes off store events, so an
 *    estimate could land in the store and change nothing a reader sees.
 *
 * The estimator is a stub throughout; all fixtures are synthetic.
