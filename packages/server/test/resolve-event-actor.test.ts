/**
 * A `thread.resolved` / `thread.reopened` broadcast names the RESOLVING
 * caller, not the thread's creator.
 *
 * Measured in the field: 17 resolves by one session each emitted a
 * `thread.resolved` frame with no actor at all, so the MCP channel renderer
 * fell back to `thread.comments[0].author` — the CREATOR — and attributed the
 * last comment's text to them. `thread.replied` on the same threads
 * attributed correctly, because the reply path passes the comment (and with
 * it the author) into the broadcast. The fix is the same seam: resolve and
 * reopen pass the acting author, and the frame carries it as `actor`.
 *
 * Everything goes through the HTTP routes the browser and MCP actually post
 * to, and the frames are read off the doc's real SSE stream — the channel a
 * watching agent consumes.
 *
 * All fixtures synthetic; port 0; no production server is touched.
