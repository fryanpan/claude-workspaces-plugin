/**
 * The legacy workspace-level TEXT goal is gone, and this file pins what that
 * removal is allowed to cost.
 *
 * Two goal systems disagreed about what a goal is: an ordered goal LIST (the
 * bands the board renders) and a single north-star paragraph on the workspace
 * (`goal` / `goalUpdatedAt`), with its own retriage machinery keyed on the
 * text. The list is the survivor. The paragraph is removed from the data
 * model, the read payloads, and the tool surface.
 *
 * What must NOT break, and is asserted here rather than assumed:
 *
 *  1. `PUT /workspaces/:id/goal` is a SHARED-SERVER route. Old plugin
 *     bundles call it from sessions nobody can restart, so it may not 404 (a
 *     route that vanished) or 500 (a route that broke). It answers 410 with a
 *     body naming the replacement — a deliberate, readable refusal that the
 *     MCP client surfaces verbatim, because a 200 would report success for a
 *     write that did not happen.
 *  2. A legacy `goal` on a create body is ignored, not rejected. Same callers.
 *  3. The stored bytes are SOFT-deleted: a sidecar written before this change
 *     keeps its `goal` text through a hydrate/persist round trip. The sidecar
 *     is the durable record; readers stop reading the field, nothing strips it.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
