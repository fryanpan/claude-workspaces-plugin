/**
 * The same opt-in gesture as `doc-activity-stall.test.ts`, applied to the
 * linked doc's DISCUSSION rather than to its prose.
 *
 * A row's own `task:<id>` doc is already read for both — a comment is the row
 * moving, and an open declaration on it is somebody being waited on. A linked
 * doc's doc was read for prose only, so a question asked where the work
 * actually is — a mock, a design doc, a diff — was invisible: the row read as
 * quiet with nobody waiting, and the wake fired on it every window while the
 * reader had it sitting on their queue. Measured on the live board on
 * 2026-09-04: five wakes in sixty-five minutes over two rows, one of them a
 * mock round awaiting an answer.
 *
 * Thread writes carry no transaction origin (`schema.ts` writes them with
 * `undefined`), and `lastContentChangeFor` deliberately refuses an unnamed
 * origin — see the origins pair in `doc-activity-stall.test.ts`. So the prose
 * fold could never have covered this, whatever the doc's mtime says.
 *
 * The board and stream fixtures are shared with that suite in
 * `doc-activity-stall-harness.ts`.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
