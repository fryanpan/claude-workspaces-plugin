/**
 * A task's own notes are movement. The stall clock reads the workspace event
 * stream, and `task.noted` is deliberately kept OFF that stream (one frame per
 * turn would wake every attached agent) — so before this, a builder that
 * reported every turn on its row still read as silent. The clock now reads
 * the row's newest note directly, whatever its kind.
 *
 * Positive control: a row quiet by events with a note two minutes ago is not
 * stalled. Negative control: the SAME row with no notes is — so the first
 * assertion cannot pass vacuously.
 *
 * Fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
