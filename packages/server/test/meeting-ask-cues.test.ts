/**
 * The two spoken cues, and the guard that holds the capture pass to them.
 *
 * The convention (Bryan, 2026-09-02 huddle): "Claude, can you …" asks for
 * something NOW, "create a task …" asks for it LATER, and speech using
 * neither is a note. Three parts, which is the shape of the feature:
 *
 * 1. The detector. Every phrase in both families and every wake-word
 *    variant, and — carrying most of the assertions — the ordinary meeting
 *    talk that must NOT read as an ask. Each of those negatives is paired
 *    with a positive control one word away from it, so a detector that had
 *    simply stopped firing could not pass this file.
 * 2. `cueLineFor`: WHICH line licensed an ask, and the spending that keeps
 *    one cue to one ask within a tick and across the boundary into the next.
 * 3. The downgrade: what `parseTaskCaptureReply` does with an ask no line
 *    cued, and what it still lets through uncued — a reference and a
 *    correction are not asks.
 *
 * Every fixture is invented speech. The repo is public.
