/**
 * Regression suite for the disk-clobber incident class (2026-07-15 and
 * 2026-08-03, reconstructed from fleet transcripts). The recurring shape:
 * an agent writes the bound .md directly, the reconcile misjudges the state,
 * and the server's own write-back flushes a stale in-memory copy over the
 * agent's file — after which even `reparse_from_disk` pulls the stale copy
 * back, because disk now holds it.
 *
 * Three root causes, each pinned by tests below:
 *  RC1  decideReconcile compared raw disk bytes against normalized serializer
 *       output, so after any applied external edit the binding looked
 *       permanently diverged and the NEXT external edit was a false conflict.
 *  RC2  scheduleFileWrite wrote blind — an external write landing inside the
 *       800ms debounce window was silently overwritten, unrecoverably.
 *  RC3  there was no whole-doc rewrite tool, which is what pushed agents into
 *       direct Writes in the first place.
