/**
 * The readable alias resolves on EVERY doc route, not only the ones inside
 * the block that canonicalizes.
 *
 * This suite exists because the first cut of the alias layer was written as
 * "the `/api/docs/<id>/…` block canonicalizes once, so its ~30 subroutes
 * inherit it" — which was true, and which quietly said nothing about the doc
 * routes matched OUTSIDE that block. Three of them (promote, archive, and the
 * share-scope guard) went on reading the raw path segment, so a caller
 * holding the readable name got a 404 or a 403 from a document that was
 * right there. That is the same shape as the hole this whole change closes:
 * a rule that is a property of one code path rather than of the system.
 *
 * So the routes are enumerated HERE, in a test, instead of being trusted to
 * the place they are implemented. A doc route added outside the
 * canonicalizing block without resolving its id goes red.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic.
