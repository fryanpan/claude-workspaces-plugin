/**
 * Correcting a review item raised on a DOC THREAD.
 *
 * The failure this covers was measured: an agent re-measured a mockup, found
 * the advice it had already given was wrong at phone width, and had no way to
 * correct it — `revise_review_item` is addressed by taskId, and a doc-thread
 * item is a review payload on a COMMENT. Its only recourse was a second item,
 * which left the reader's queue carrying two rows about one question with the
 * older, wronger one still reading as live.
 *
 * Two things have to hold and each has its own test. The superseded wording
 * stays readable as history — soft-delete discipline, because a person may
 * already have read it — and the reader can tell a correction from a fresh
 * ask, which is what the queue assertions at the bottom are for. A revision
 * the reader cannot recognise would remove the duplicate and keep the
 * confusion, which is half a fix.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the jordan@partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.
