/**
 * A workspace share visitor must not learn where the review lives.
 *
 * `/api/docs/<id>` has been redacted since the share-visitor hardening work,
 * but the two WORKSPACE endpoints in a visitor's scope built their payload
 * themselves rather than returning a DocMeta, so nothing redacted them:
 *
 *   GET /api/attachments/<setId>/tree  → `root` (absolute host path) + every
 *   GET /api/attachments/<setId>/files    node's `reviewUrl` on the tailnet host
 *
 * Those are the addresses the calls below use. They also answered under
 * `/workspaces/<setId>/…` once; the canonical-routes cutover deleted that
 * alias, because `/workspaces/<id>/…` is a BOARD's address now.
 *
 * Found by probing the RUNNING server with a real workspace link over the
 * public hostname, not by reading the code — the unit layer was fine and the
 * doc route was fine; only these two siblings leaked.
 *
 * Every assertion here is an absence, so each one is paired with a control:
 * the owner's copy must still CONTAIN the field, otherwise "the visitor
 * doesn't see root" would pass on an endpoint that returns nothing at all.
