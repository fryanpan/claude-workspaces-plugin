/**
 * A person's reply to a RESOLVED thread reopens it.
 *
 * The drawer's default tab is "Open", and `filtered()` drops resolved
 * threads from it entirely. So a reply that leaves the thread resolved is a
 * reply nobody sees: a reviewer replied three minutes after an agent resolved
 * the thread, and reported it as *comments going missing*. Nothing was lost —
 * `list_threads` had every word — but the review surface had no way to show
 * it to them.
 *
 * The asymmetry is deliberate. A person replying is continuing the
 * conversation; an AGENT replying is often posting a closing note, and
 * resurrecting a thread the human just closed would be its own bug. The
 * actor split reuses `classifyActor`, the same one the activity log uses.
 *
 * Everything here goes through the HTTP route the browser actually posts to
 * — `postComment` is reachable three ways and the route is the layer no unit
 * test covers.
