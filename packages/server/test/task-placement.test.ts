/**
 * A create says what happened to the task's PLACEMENT.
 *
 * The gap this closes, reproduced against a live server before any of it was
 * written: a workspace with two real goal bands, a create that names no
 * `goal`, and the response is `{ task: { goal: "chores", ... } }` and nothing
 * else. The agent that just generated the work — the one party that still
 * knows why the task exists and is best placed to rank it — cannot tell
 * "Backlog because I asked for Backlog" from "Backlog because I named nothing
 * and now nobody will ever place it", and does not know the bands exist
 * without a second `get_workspace` it has no reason to make.
 *
 * So the fix is not to guess a band. Auto-filing an unjudged task into the
 * top band fails in the dangerous direction — it outranks work somebody
 * actually ranked, and stamps a placement nobody made. The fix is to make
 * the create SAY it, grounded in what happened rather than inferred:
 * `placed` comes from whether the caller named a goal, and the bands come
 * along so the caller can act in the same breath.
 *
 * The server used to ALSO emit a `triage.requested` ask at this moment and
 * report whether it was delivered. That flow was removed on 2026-08-24 — the
 * lead is woken by the board's own events. The absence of that frame is
 * pinned in attachments.test.ts, where the stream is already in hand.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic.
