/**
 * The layer nothing type-checks: `bin.ts` hand-parses argv, so `--deploy`
 * can be declared and silently dropped — and this repo has shipped exactly
 * that bug at the route layer.
 *
 * Both arms run against a REAL spawned `bin.ts`, because the claim under
 * test is about the seam: a server that was not told it is the deploy must
 * not be able to pull or restart anything, and the flag that tells it must
 * actually arrive.
 *
 * Neither arm ever POSTs to /api/deploy. A GET is read-only by construction
 * (it reports the last result and runs nothing), which is precisely what
 * makes it safe to point at a process that IS holding a real deployer.
