/**
 * Stopping a meeting is a notes moment of its own.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS PINS. The two clocks that fire a tick — a pause of four
 * seconds, a ceiling of fifteen — both need the meeting to keep going. The
 * sentence somebody is in the middle of when they press stop is waiting on a
 * tick that never comes: the pause clock is disarmed by the stop, the ceiling
 * with it, and the turn had never settled, so the flush at `end()` found an
 * empty delta and wrote nothing. Everything said in the last stretch of a
 * meeting went into the transcript and never into the notes.
 *
 * So the final pass takes the turns that were still being SPOKEN as well as
 * the ones that had settled, and the composer is told which is which.
 *
 * The second half of this file is the merge invariant that the final pass
 * must not cost: a person types in the notes section while the meeting runs,
 * and the next bullet — the last one included — still appends under their
 * line rather than replacing it or opening a section of its own.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
