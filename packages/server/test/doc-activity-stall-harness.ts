/**
 * The board-and-stream fixtures the two doc-activity stall suites share.
 *
 * `doc-activity-stall.test.ts` asks whether editing a row's linked doc counts
 * as the row moving; `doc-thread-activity-stall.test.ts` asks the same of the
 * doc's DISCUSSION. Both stand up a real server on an ephemeral port, hold the
 * workspace stream open as an attached lead, and read the stall wake off it,
 * so the frame reader and the quiet window belong to neither file alone.
 *
 * `listenFrames` collects frames rather than draining them, which is what
 * separates it from `agent-stream.ts`: these suites assert on what the wake
 * SAID, not merely that a subscriber existed.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the jordan@partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.

 * it would name moved inside the moved-within window, which the wiring derives
 * as twice this (`stall-frame-news.ts`). It was halved from 250ms when that
