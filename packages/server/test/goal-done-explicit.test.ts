/**
 * A goal is done when somebody SAYS it is done.
 *
 * Bryan, 2026-08-20: *"No, let's not do anything automatic. Let's say a goal
 * is done when marked done by an agent or person."* So there is no roll-up
 * rule and no auto-close, and the absence is asserted here rather than left to
 * be true by accident — `closing every child leaves the goal open` is the test
 * that would catch somebody adding the derivation later because it looked
 * helpful.
 *
 * Why declared rather than derived, since a derived status can never
 * contradict its children: because it says something false in both directions.
 * A goal whose children are all done is not thereby achieved — that is the
 * entire reason a goal gets prose of its own. And a goal can be genuinely
 * achieved another way, or abandoned, while children remain open. Worse, a
 * derived status has no actor and no chosen moment, so it cannot produce an
 * audit row, and this store's contract is that every status change lands in
 * `transitions` with an actor and a kind.
 *
 * The children are reported and never enforced — "a goal is done because you
 * say so; the children are reported, not enforced". That reuses the advisory
 * arm of the gate that already exists for `after` edges rather than inventing
 * a second notion of blocked, and the tests below pin both halves: the open
 * children come back on the result, and the move still lands.
 *
 * Note what this feature did NOT need: a route, a tool, or a second status
 * machine. A goal moves through the same `transition` gate every task moves
 * through, so `POST /api/tasks/:id/transition` reaches one already — asserted
 * at the bottom, because a new shared-server REST route is the thing old
 * plugin bundles could never call and this design gets to skip.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
