/**
 * Static assets are compressed, and a repeat load can be answered with a 304.
 *
 * The board shell is a ~1 KB HTML page that then pulls its CSS and JS. Those
 * two files, plus the widget bundle, were the largest thing this server sent
 * anyone — and they went out raw: no `content-encoding`, and `cache-control:
 * no-cache` with NEITHER an `etag` nor a `last-modified` to revalidate
 * against. Those two facts compound rather than merely coexisting. `no-cache`
 * does not mean "do not store", it means "revalidate before use" — but a
 * revalidation needs a validator, and with none present the only answer the
 * server can give is the whole body again. So every board load re-sent every
 * byte, and none of the bytes were compressed.
 *
 * That is invisible on a desktop beside the server and dominates the load on a
 * phone or tablet over a slow link, which is exactly where the board is read.
 *
 * The compression gate stays an allowlist rather than becoming a `text/*`
 * sweep. The hazard it exists to prevent is buffering a LIVE stream in order
 * to compress it, which would hold every event until the stream closed; this
 * server's only streaming body is SSE, and the last test here pins that
 * `text/event-stream` is still excluded. Adding a type to the list is a claim
 * that bodies of that type are finite, and css/js/svg/html are.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
