/**
 * The per-doc cost of a hydrated doc.
 *
 * On 2026-08-29 the server reached 2.6 GB and was killed by jetsam. Hydration
 * loads every persisted doc, and each hydrated doc used to construct a
 * y-protocols `Awareness` (a 3s interval per doc, never unref'd) and, if the
 * doc was file-bound, a 500ms stat poll — both running forever whether or not
 * anybody had the doc open. These tests pin the three costs down: no presence
 * timer without a connection, no stat syscalls for a doc nobody is looking at,
 * and no stat-per-doc on a list.
