/**
 * A review's API answers under `/api/attachments/<setId>/…`, and ONLY there.
 *
 * The endpoints once existed under `/api/workspaces/<id>/…` too, because a
 * diff review and a bound folder used to BE a second kind of workspace. That
 * alias was kept alive for callers nobody could restart. It is gone now: the
 * canonical-routes cutover moved the whole `/api/workspaces/*` family to
 * `/workspaces/*`, which is a board's address, and an attachment set is not a
 * board. Keeping the alias would have re-created the confusion the split was
 * for — a review id answering at a board's path.
 *
 * So each route is asserted twice, and the second half is the one with teeth:
 * the review spelling answers, AND the retired workspace spelling does not.
 * A test that only checked the live path would still pass on the day the
 * alias came back.
 *
 * The delete pair is asserted the other way round as well — `delete_attachment_set`
 * must NOT be able to destroy a board — because that is the whole reason the
 * verb was split rather than renamed.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic.
