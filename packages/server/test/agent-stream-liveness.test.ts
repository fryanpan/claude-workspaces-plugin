/**
 * The socket the agent is holding open is better evidence than the clock.
 *
 * `voice-gate-liveness.test.ts` fixed the previous round of this: liveness
 * moved from "did the model remember to call `heartbeat`" to "did the server
 * OBSERVE this agent inside `OBSERVED_LIVE_MS`", where an observation is a
 * heartbeat or a write. That is strictly better and it still loses messages,
 * because it measures the wrong process.
 *
 * Measured here 2026-08-19, on this session: an utterance arrived at 16:41:18
 * with the agent's last observation at 16:22:09 — a 19.1-minute gap against a
 * 15-minute window, so it queued. Those nineteen minutes were `grep`, `sed`,
 * a read-only `curl` and a scratchpad file: an agent working continuously and
 * hard, making zero calls that this server could see. `attachment-keepalive.ts`
 * did not save it either, because that piggybacks on MCP tool calls and there
 * were none to ride.
 *
 * The whole time, the MCP child process was holding an SSE stream open on
 * `/workspaces/<id>/events:stream` — the very channel the delivery would have ridden.
 * The server had a live socket to the agent and declined to use it because a
 * language model had not spoken in nineteen minutes.
 *
 * So delivery asks the socket. Two properties this must have and a third it
 * must NOT acquire:
 *
 *  1. The stream names its agent, so "is that agent reachable" is answerable.
 *     A browser tab on the same board sends no agentId and therefore cannot
 *     make an absent agent look present — the previous round's `DeliveryProbe`
 *     could only ever count subscribers, which is why it was allowed to narrow
 *     the answer and never widen it. This one may widen it because it is
 *     specific.
 *  2. Anything that does queue comes back on the agent's next observation
 *     rather than its next `attach_agent`. A long-running session attaches
 *     once, at startup; parking a message until the next attach is parking it
 *     until the next restart.
 *  3. It must NOT move the DISPLAYED state. `attachmentState` renders
 *     "process up, agent unresponsive" from a fresh heartbeat against a stale
 *     tool call, and `attachment-keepalive.ts` deliberately refuses a timer to
 *     protect exactly that distinction. Reachability and working-ness are
 *     different questions; this file pins that they stay different.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
