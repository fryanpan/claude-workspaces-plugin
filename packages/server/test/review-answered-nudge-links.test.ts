/**
 * The `workspace.review_answered` wake, rendered from the frames the SERVER
 * really sends rather than from hand-written fixtures.
 *
 * Same lesson as `decision-answered-line.test.ts` next door, one hop further
 * out. That suite could read its rows back from `events.jsonl`; this one
 * cannot, because a nudge is a DELIVERY rather than a change and deliberately
 * never reaches the audit log (see ready-nudge.ts). So the read-back surface
 * here is the wire itself: an attached lead holding its SSE stream, and the
 * addressed frame that arrives on it.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole reason this test exists. The clause under
 * test is about a field — `links` — that the frame did not carry at all until
 * now, and a fixture asserting `links: []` would have proved the renderer
 * guards a key nobody sends. Only the real frame can tell those apart.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
