/**
 * "Back" from a doc should return to the BOARD that links it, not to the
 * machine-wide landing page.
 *
 * Reproduced on a running server before this existed: the review app's `←`
 * is a static `href="/"` in `packages/workspaces-app/index.html`, so opening
 * any doc from a board and tapping back lands on the list of everything on
 * the machine. The client cannot fix that alone — nothing in the page says
 * which board owns the doc, and `document.referrer` is empty for a URL that
 * arrived in a message. So the server answers it, on the payload the review
 * app already fetches before it mounts a surface.
 *
 * Two shapes have to resolve, and they are NOT the same lookup:
 *   - a plain doc is attached to the board by its own docId;
 *   - a diff review / folder browse goes on a board as ONE row, attached by
 *     its GROUPING id, so a member doc is never in `docIds` and a direct
 *     lookup answers null for every file in the review.
 *
 * Everything here goes through the real HTTP routes: the route layer
 * hand-copies fields and is the layer no unit test covers.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic.
