/**
 * Reading a task note for an ask to a person nobody filed.
 *
 * Two things are under test and they fail differently. The PREFILTER is a
 * table: every fixture below is the shape of a note a live agent actually
 * writes, half of them asks and half of them not, and the table is what says
 * the vocabulary separates them rather than merely matching the asks. The
 * CLASSIFIER is about cost and about what happens when the judge is not
 * there — one call per note ever, a `no` that cancels the finding, and a
 * failure that leaves the prefilter's verdict standing.
 *
 * Fixture texts follow the shapes of the 2026-09-04 incident; every person
 * named other than the board's owner is invented, and the repo is public.
