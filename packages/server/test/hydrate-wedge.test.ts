/**
 * A bound file that never answers must not stop the server answering.
 *
 * The 2026-09-04 outage: a doc bound into a cloud-sync folder whose file
 * provider had stopped responding. The SSE subscribe route hydrated the doc,
 * hydration called `readFileSync`, and the main thread parked in `openat`. The
 * server answered nothing at all — not other docs, not the health route — the
 * supervisor restarted it, the subscriber reconnected, and it wedged again.
 * Twenty-one times.
 *
 * A FIFO with no writer reproduces that exactly and without any cloud storage:
 * `stat` answers, and `open` blocks until somebody opens the other end, which
 * in this file nobody ever does. Measured on the pre-fix code, `readFileSync`
 * on such a path never returns and no timer on the loop fires again.
 *
 * The doc, the paths and the content here are invented.
