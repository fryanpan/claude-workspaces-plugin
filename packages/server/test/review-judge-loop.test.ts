/**
 * The hold loop — what stops the quality gate asking, round after round, for
 * something the item already says.
 *
 * Reported by a peer on 2026-09-04: one decision item was held eight times
 * with contradictory reasons, and the last hold asked for costs the options
 * stated verbatim. The peer's reading was that option `detail` fields were
 * dropped before the judge saw them. The first describe block below is the
 * control for that reading, driven through the REAL prompt builder: it holds
 * only when the costs are genuinely absent from the words the model reads.
 *
 * What a judge FAILURE does — and what a crash mid-judge leaves behind — is
 * next door in `review-judge-recovery.test.ts`. The harness is shared.
