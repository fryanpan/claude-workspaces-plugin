/**
 * A BOARD is the only thing that can be shared.
 *
 * Bryan, 2026-08-17: "Workspace only — a review must be filed on a board
 * before it can be shared." The per-doc half shipped separately (see
 * `per-doc-share-removed.test.ts`); this file is the GROUPING half — the
 * folder bind and the diff review, which used to be shareable on their own
 * because `POST /api/share/link` forked on `taskStore.getWorkspace(id)` and
 * fell through to a member lookup when the id was not a board.
 *
 * The discriminator here is NOT the shape of the payload, which is what made
 * the per-doc removal cheap to guard. An older bundle sends a grouping id and
 * a board id in the SAME `workspaceId` field, so the only thing that can tell
 * them apart is a lookup: a board is what `taskStore` answers for, and a
 * grouping is what only `docStore` knows about. Every assertion below therefore
 * pairs a refusal with a board doing the same thing on the same server — a
 * server that answered nothing at all would otherwise pass this whole file.
 *
 * Three separate things have to be true, and each fails differently:
 *
 *  1. Nothing can MINT a grouping share, including an older peer's bundle
 *     calling the shared :8787 with the payload ITS bundle sends. Requests
 *     below are transcribed from the committed 0.1.80 bundle
 *     (`packages/plugin/mcp/index.js`, `case "share_workspace"` and
 *     `case "share_link"`), not from today's source.
 *
 *  2. A grouping share already ON DISK stops granting. Removing the mint
 *     path alone retires the feature everywhere except where it is exercised.
 *     Unlike the per-doc case this cannot be a load-time drop — `Shares` has
 *     no way to ask what a board is — so it is enforced where the share is
 *     resolved for serving, and the record stays on disk (soft delete).
 *
 *  3. The replacement still works AND is still fast: filing a review on a
 *     board and sharing the board reaches every member, in one create call
 *     plus one share call.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.
