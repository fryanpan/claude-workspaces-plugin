/**
 * A failed client build keeps the previous release live — "stale beats down" —
 * but until this, the ONLY record of that decision was a line on stderr in a
 * launchd log nobody reads. A build that keeps failing therefore means an
 * ever-older client against an ever-newer server, silently: reproduced by
 * publishing once, failing twice, and finding nothing whatsoever on disk that
 * remembers it happened.
 *
 * So the publish now leaves two readable traces: provenance INSIDE each
 * release (when it was published, and from which source), and a failure ledger
 * beside the releases (how many attempts in a row have failed, since when,
 * with what error). Everything a surface needs to say "your browser is running
 * a client from N days ago and the build has been failing since X" comes from
 * those two files.
 *
 * Fixtures are synthetic.
