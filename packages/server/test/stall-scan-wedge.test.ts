/**
 * The stall scan walks every doc on a board. One that will not answer must
 * not stop it.
 *
 * `hydrate-wedge.test.ts` covers the REQUEST paths — an SSE subscribe, a doc
 * GET. This file covers the other half of the 2026-09-04 shape, and the half
 * with no client on the end of it: a TIMER. `nudgeStalls` runs on a 60s
 * interval, and `heldThreadReviewItems` inside it calls `docStore.listThreads`
 * once per task body, once per goal body and once per attached doc — none of
 * which reaches a URL, so nothing prewarms them. On the pre-fix code the first
 * cold doc bound into a sick folder parked the whole process from a timer
 * callback, with no request to blame it on.
 *
 * A FIFO with no writer is the reproduction: `stat` answers, `open` blocks
 * until somebody opens the other end, and in this file nobody ever does.
 *
 * NOTE ON FAILURE MODE: a regression here does not fail this test, it HANGS
 * it — `nudgeStalls` is synchronous, so a blocking read inside it parks the
 * runner and the assertions below are never reached. The runner's own timeout
 * is what turns that into a red test. That is inherent to asserting on a
 * synchronous call; there is no way to race a timer against code that owns
 * the only thread. Verified by mutation: restoring the synchronous fallback
 * in `DocStore.prereadFor` hangs this file rather than failing it.
 *
 * The criterion behind this file asks for a scan "under 100ms". It is
 * asserted here as a COUNT — a pool read outstanding when the scan returns —
 * because testing-standards §3 bans elapsed-time assertions, and because the
 * count is the stronger claim: a scan that skipped the doc would also be
 * fast.
 *
 * The board, the doc and the paths here are invented.
