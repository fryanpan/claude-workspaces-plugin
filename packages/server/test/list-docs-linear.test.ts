/**
 * GET /api/docs resolves every row's board from ONE pass over the workspaces.
 *
 * It used to take two per row. `withReviewUrl` → `resolveWorkspaceForDoc` →
 * `backTargetFor` called `boardWorkspacesHolding` twice for every doc, and each
 * call ran `listWorkspaces().filter(w => w.docIds.includes(id))` — a fresh
 * array of every board, then a linear scan of its docIds. Quadratic in the
 * doc count, and paid in full by the docs no board holds, which once a server
 * accumulates diff-review members is most of them.
 *
 * That is worse than a slow endpoint. Bun runs JS on one thread, so a listing
 * that takes tens of seconds is tens of seconds in which the server answers
 * nothing else at all. The process stays alive and stays bound throughout, so
 * a supervisor sees a healthy server — including the bind-health watchdog,
 * which asks whether the port is listening and never whether it answers.
 *
 * The invariant is asserted by COUNTING the passes rather than by timing the
 * request. A wall-clock budget would encode this machine's speed and would go
 * red on a loaded CI box for a reason that has nothing to do with the bug;
 * the number of times a listing re-reads the workspace set is the thing that
 * must not scale with the number of rows.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
