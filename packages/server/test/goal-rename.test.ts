/**
 * Renaming a goal without stranding the work filed under it.
 *
 * `set_goal_list` is a full REPLACE keyed by id, and there was no rename
 * verb — so the natural way to rename a band was to submit the list with a
 * new id and the new title. To the store that is one goal removed and a
 * different one added: the removal swept the old band's OPEN tasks to the
 * bottom of Backlog, and left its DONE tasks pointing at an id no longer in
 * the list (the bare row `get_workspace` has to append, which is why #153
 * needed `reorderable`). Nothing errored, the new title appeared, and the
 * caller believed it worked. Reproduced end-to-end against a live server
 * before any of this was written.
 *
 * Two changes, tested at both layers:
 *
 *   1. `renameGoal` — retitle by id at either scope. No reachable input
 *      regroups anything, which is the whole point: the common case never
 *      goes near the replace.
 *   2. `setGoalList` REFUSES a replace that drops an id still holding tasks
 *      unless the caller names that id in `drop`. A stale caller cannot name
 *      a goal it never read, which is exactly the case the guard is for.
 *      Removing an EMPTY goal needs no ceremony — the guard can only refuse
 *      a call that was about to lose track of real work.
 *
 * Goal ids are generated now, so the re-key spelling of a rename ("submit
 * the list with a new id") is refused earlier still, as `unknown-goal-id` —
 * a caller cannot name an id the board does not hold. The removal the
 * stranding guard exists for is therefore reached the only way that is left:
 * by OMITTING a band that is still there. Every fixture below seeds its bands
 * through `seedGoals` and refers to them by the ids that came back.
 *
 * The route layer gets its own describe block because it is the layer
 * nothing type-checks: `drop` is precisely the shape of param a hand-copying
 * handler accepts and discards while still answering 200 (the `groups`
 * lesson). Every absence assertion sits next to a positive control.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the jordan@partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.
