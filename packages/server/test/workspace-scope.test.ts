/**
 * The one middleware that resolves a canonical `/workspaces/<id>/…` request,
 * driven both directly and over the real routes.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The routes cutover put the board in the PATH so that
 * the access question could be answered once, above every handler, by
 * something that reads paths — `middleware/workspace-scope.ts`. A rule that
 * runs in one place is only worth the move if it is asserted in one place
 * too, so this drives it directly for the shapes a route cannot produce, and
 * then over HTTP for every collection that moved, because the route layer is
 * the part nothing type-checks.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ARE ASSERTED, and the second is the one the old shape could not
 * even express. A board that does not exist is refused. And a ROW filed on
 * another board, named under a board that does exist, is refused as well —
 * `/workspaces/<A>/goals/<band-on-B>` was not a shape a request could have
 * while the path was `/api/goals/<id>` and named no board at all.
 *
 * Every refusal is 404 with no detail, and the tests say so on purpose: a
 * 403 on a foreign id confirms the id is real to whoever guessed it.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic.
