/**
 * The whole meeting pipeline, end to end through the real server: a scripted
 * meeting with pauses streams over the audio socket, and the doc gains notes
 * AT the pauses and nowhere else — never while speech is in progress, never
 * a partial, never the word an engine correction took back. Then the same
 * doc runs a SECOND meeting, because stop/start is how real meetings go and
 * the recording state, the meeting index, and the notes section all have to
 * come out of it consistent.
 *
 * The engine is the mock (per-chunk, no network), the composer is the stub
 * (deterministic, no network), the quiet timer is the manual scheduler — a
 * pause here is `schedule.fire()`, not elapsed time. Nothing in this file
 * can open a billed session.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
