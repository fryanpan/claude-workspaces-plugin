/**
 * The `triage` status: a row nobody has vetted yet.
 *
 * A task an agent files is a proposal, not a decision — so it lands in
 * `triage`, keeps its band position, and is invisible to every dispatch read
 * until somebody moves it out. A person filing a task has already made the
 * decision, so their rows skip triage entirely. Clearing is not a separate
 * verb: ANY attributed move out through the ordinary transition gate does it,
 * and the trail that gate already writes is the record of who cleared it.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the jordan@partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.
