/**
 * The activity view (§3.9) reads events.jsonl — so its renderer has to be
 * fed the rows the SERVER actually writes, not hand-written fixtures.
 *
 * This is the "a unit test can be true and still prove nothing about the
 * caller" lesson applied to the audit log: `describeEvent`'s own suite
 * invents shapes (a `decision.answered` with no answer at all), and under
 * those the renderer silently dropped every verbatim decision answer —
 * reading `ev.answer.text` where the emitted row carries a plain string.
 * "Decisions keep the words" failed on the one surface built to review them.
 *
 * So: drive the real routes, read the real log back, and render THOSE rows
 * with the real client model. `board-presence-model.ts` is pure (no DOM, no fetch), so
 * a server test can import it directly.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the carol@partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.
