/**
 * Binding a diff over a tree that has stopped answering.
 *
 * `hydrate-wedge-unprewarmed.test.ts` covers the hydration doors. This covers
 * the other half of the same hazard: a BIND, which is the one operation that
 * opens many caller-supplied paths in a row. `create_diff_review` walks every
 * changed file in a repository the caller named, and until this was fixed each
 * one of them was a `readFileSync` on the main thread — so a single file in a
 * cloud-sync folder whose provider had stopped answering parked the whole
 * server for the length of one bind, and a bigger review meant more chances to
 * do it.
 *
 * A FIFO with no writer reproduces the sick provider exactly: `stat` answers,
 * `open` blocks until somebody opens the other end, and nobody here ever does.
 * `git diff --name-status` still lists such a file as modified (its `--numstat`
 * pass fails cleanly and the review simply carries no line counts), so the bind
 * reaches the read with a member it fully intends to open.
 *
 * The repository, its files and its contents are invented.
