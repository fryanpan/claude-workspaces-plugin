/**
 * What a band in triage does to the work under it.
 *
 * A goal in triage is a band nobody has agreed to yet, and the rows under it
 * inherit that: they are still listed, still ranked, still visible on every
 * board surface — and no wake will ever name one.
 *
 * ── Listed, not dropped — and why that is the opposite of a triage TASK ──
 *
 * A triage TASK leaves `buildQueue` entirely (`t.status !== 'triage'`). A row
 * under a triage GOAL does not, and the difference is deliberate.
 *
 * The precedent it follows is `backlog` — a row outside every ranked band.
 * That row is also never auto-dispatched, and it is also still returned,
 * because the gate one rung up has to be able to SAY so. `considered` is a
 * denominator: drop the rows and an all-triage board reports "nothing ready"
 * exactly as an empty board does, which is the single failure the ready gate
 * was rebuilt to prevent. Bryan asked for the report to show these rows as
 * "goal in triage" rather than fail on them, and a row that is not in the
 * queue cannot be shown as anything.
 *
 * So the queue marks the row and the gate withholds it. A lead reading
 * `next_tasks` sees the band and can disagree with it; a wake never spends
 * somebody's turn on it.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the jordan@partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.
