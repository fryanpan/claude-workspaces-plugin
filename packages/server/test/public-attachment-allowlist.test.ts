/**
 * `publicAttachment` is the projection a share or collab visitor's
 * `GET <ws>/attachments` returns, and it must be an ALLOWLIST.
 *
 * It used to destructure `endpoint` out and spread the rest, which means a
 * field added to `AgentAttachment` later shipped to visitors by default and
 * stayed there until somebody noticed. Every neighbouring visitor projection
 * — `redactMetaForVisitor`, `redactBoardWorkspaceForVisitor` — was rewritten to
 * the opposite rule after a leak, each with a header saying why; this was the
 * last one still built the old way.
 *
 * The test that matters is the one a denylist cannot pass: a field the
 * projection was never told about must not survive. It is expressed by
 * handing the function a record carrying an extra key, which is exactly the
 * shape the NEXT `AgentAttachment` field will have before anyone updates this
 * file.
 *
 * Fixtures are synthetic. Nothing here is a real endpoint or host.
