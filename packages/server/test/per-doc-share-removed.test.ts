/**
 * Per-doc sharing is gone — a WORKSPACE is the unit of sharing.
 *
 * Bryan, 2026-08-17: "Remove all code for sharing docs, reviews and so on
 * individually. Share a workspace."
 *
 * Three things have to be true for that removal to be real, and each fails
 * differently:
 *
 *  1. Nothing can MINT a doc-scoped share any more — including an older
 *     plugin bundle, which keeps calling the shared :8787 routes with the
 *     payload ITS bundle sends long after this one stopped sending it. Every
 *     request below is transcribed verbatim from the committed bundle at
 *     0.1.41 (`packages/plugin/mcp/index.js`, `case "share_doc"` and
 *     `case "share_link"`), not from today's source.
 *
 *  2. A doc-scoped share already ON DISK stops being honoured. Removing the
 *     mint path alone would retire the feature everywhere except where it is
 *     actually exercised — the registry is what the gate reads.
 *
 *  3. The replacement still works. Every assertion here is an absence, so
 *     each one is paired with a live share doing the same thing in the same
 *     test. Without that pair, a server that answered nothing at all would
 *     pass this entire file.
 *
 * Those positive controls used to be minted over the folder bind. A BOARD is
 * the unit of sharing now — the grouping removal that followed this one is
 * covered in grouping-share-removed.test.ts — so the bind is FILED on a board
 * and the control shares the board. The pairing is the point, and it only
 * works if the control is something that still mints.
