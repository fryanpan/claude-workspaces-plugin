/**
 * Every settled turn of a meeting is accounted for: a note, or a skip on
 * purpose. Nothing may simply vanish.
 *
 * WHY AN AUDIT AND NOT MORE UNIT TESTS. The ways a meeting loses words are
 * spread across five modules — the ticker's delta, the compose chain's carry,
 * the composer's own reply, the ownership merge, and the section finder — and
 * each of them has tests that pass while the meeting as a whole drops a
 * stretch of conversation. The only statement that catches all five is about
 * the WHOLE meeting: run a scripted one end to end, then ask of every turn
 * that settled whether the notes say anything about it.
 *
 * HOW A SKIP IS LEGITIMATE. Most of what is said in a meeting is not a note —
 * greetings, thinking aloud, a point going round again — and the note-taker is
 * asked to filter hard. So the script declares, per utterance, either the note
 * it should produce or the reason it carries none. A turn with neither is the
 * failure this audit exists to find: words that went into the transcript, were
 * never deliberately dropped, and are in no note.
 *
 * THE SCRIPT IS CUT THE WAY THE CLOCKS CUT IT. Utterances run about six
 * seconds each and arrive in runs with a pause between them, which is what
 * the pause clock sees in a real meeting; `MEETING_SECONDS` below is that
 * arithmetic, asserted rather than claimed. The last run ends mid-sentence,
 * because that is how a person stops a recording.
 *
 * All speech here is synthetic. The repo is public.
