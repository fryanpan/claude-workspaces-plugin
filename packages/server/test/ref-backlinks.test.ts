/**
 * POST /workspaces/<ws>/refs:backlinks — which of a board's tasks point at
 * THIS ref.
 *
 * `backlinksFor(ref)` has always been able to answer it for any ref kind.
 * The HTTP surface could only ask it about a `task` ref (`GET
 * /api/tasks/<id>/links`) or a doc/thread (`GET /api/docs/<id>/tasks`), so
 * the question the `url` kind was ADDED for — "which tasks point at this
 * pull request" — was answerable in the store and nowhere else. `diff` refs
 * had no route at all.
 *
 * A POST for a read is deliberate: a ref is a structured value of up to
 * three fields, one of which is an arbitrary URL. Encoding that into a
 * query string puts caller URLs into every access log and proxy on the
 * path, for no gain — the route has no side effects either way.
 *
 * Route-level, per the groups lesson: the store method was already correct
 * and unit-tested; the layer that was missing is the one nothing
 * type-checks.
 *
 * The board in the address is the question's OWNER, not a hint. Until the
 * canonical-routes cutover this route sat outside `/workspaces/` and answered
 * across every board on the server, so a member of one board could read a
 * private row's title, id, status and assignee off another by asking about a
 * ref they both happened to cite. The tests below are written from both
 * sides of that boundary: each board sees its own citer and not the other's,
 * and neither is ever answered with the union.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the jordan@partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.
