/**
 * "Is somebody already on this row?" — asked where the pickup decision is
 * actually made.
 *
 * The fixture is the 2026-08-17 collision on a single task row: two sessions
 * dispatched onto one task, hours of work each, two complete answers, one
 * thrown away. Neither could detect the other because the surface they pick
 * work from — the queue — carried a bare `assignee` STRING and nothing about
 * whether anyone was behind it.
 *
 * Two properties every assertion here is really about:
 *
 *  - The read is built on RECENCY, never on content identity. Nothing in this
 *    file commits anything, pushes anything, or moves a sha — a session that
 *    thinks for an hour produces no new content and must still read as taken.
 *    A sha-based signal scores zero on every case below.
 *  - It only ever informs. There is no assertion that a second claim is
 *    refused, because a second claim must not be refused: two agents on one
 *    row is sometimes right, and on that row the disagreement between
 *    the two designs is what made the choice legible.
