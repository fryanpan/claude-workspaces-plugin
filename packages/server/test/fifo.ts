/**
 * FIFOs, for the tests that need a file whose `open` never returns.
 *
 * A named pipe with no writer is the only portable way to reproduce the
 * 2026-09-04 outage without cloud storage: `stat` answers, `open` blocks until
 * somebody opens the other end. That is exactly what the sick file provider
 * did, and it is what `slow-fs.ts` exists to survive.
 *
 * The catch is that a blocked read owns a thread pool slot until it is
 * released, and the process cannot be relied on to exit while it is held —
 * a test file that walks away from four of them can hang the runner instead
 * of failing it. So every test that opens one closes it here, deterministically:
 * open the pipe for writing (which unblocks the parked reader), close it
 * (which hands the reader EOF), then wait for `slow-fs` to report that it owns
 * no parked read at all. If that wait runs out, this throws with the count
 * rather than letting the suite hang.
 *
 * `O_NONBLOCK` on the write side is what makes it safe to call on a pipe
 * nobody is reading: instead of blocking in turn, the open fails with ENXIO
 * and says so — which is also how the loop below knows when it is done.
