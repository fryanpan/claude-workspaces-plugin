/**
 * `GET /api/metrics` — what this process currently costs, on demand.
 *
 * The 2026-08-29 jetsam kill left nothing to read: the server had reached
 * 2.6 GB and the only evidence of how it got there was the absence of the
 * process. The same numbers go to the log every five minutes; this route is
 * what lets the NEXT incident be sampled over time rather than reconstructed
 * afterwards.
 *
 * The two things worth pinning are that the counts track a seeded fixture
 * (a route that always answered zero would look healthy through any storm)
 * and that it stays counts-only — no doc ids, paths or titles, which is what
 * makes it safe to serve.
 *
 * Synthetic fixture, port 0. No production server is touched.
