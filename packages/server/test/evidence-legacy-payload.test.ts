/**
 * Evidence support was removed from the product. Two promises outlive it, and
 * this file is the only place either one is pinned:
 *
 *  1. **The shared server keeps accepting the old payload.** A peer running a
 *     plugin bundle from a session that has not restarted goes on POSTing
 *     `evidence` on every forward transition, and goes on calling the amend
 *     route. Neither may start failing: a caller nobody can restart, getting
 *     an unexplainable error from its own version, is the exact hazard
 *     CLAUDE.md names. Accept and ignore — never 400, never 500.
 *  2. **Evidence already on disk stays on disk.** The chosen option was
 *     "existing transitions keep their stored evidence but nothing reads or
 *     renders it". Reading stops; the record does not move. Nothing here is
 *     satisfied by an assertion that no migration was written — the fixture is
 *     a sidecar with real evidence on it, and the check is what the sidecar
 *     holds after the store has hydrated, written, and persisted over it.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic.
