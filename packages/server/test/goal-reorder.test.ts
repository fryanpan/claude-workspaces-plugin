/**
 * reorder_goals — the permutation-only priority gesture.
 *
 * `setGoalList` is a full REPLACE: reordering with it means restating every
 * id and title, and any id a stale caller leaves out sends that goal's open
 * tasks to the bottom of Backlog. `reorderGoals` exists so the most ordinary
 * gesture on a board — "move this band above that one" — cannot do that. Its
 * whole contract is that `order` must be EXACTLY the ids already at one
 * scope: anything omitted, repeated, or invented is refused with the
 * offending ids named, never merged best-effort.
 *
 * Two layers, because the route is the one nothing type-checks (the `groups`
 * lesson): the store semantics below, then the same contract driven over
 * HTTP with the stored effect read back. Every absence assertion (no event,
 * no task moved, no mutation) sits next to a positive control.
 *
 * Goal ids are generated, so no fixture here can name one in advance: each
 * board is seeded through `seedGoals` and every test refers to its bands by
 * the ids that came back. An id a test INVENTS (`g-social`) stays invented —
 * that is the stale-caller case these refusals are about.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the jordan@partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.
