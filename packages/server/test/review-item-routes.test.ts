/**
 * HTTP-level tests for the Review Item payload — through the REAL routes.
 *
 * Every comment-writing route hand-copies body fields into the store call,
 * and that is the one layer nothing type-checks; this repo has shipped
 * "accepted it, returned 200, discarded it" more than once. So each of the
 * three write routes gets a test that reads the stored EFFECT back through a
 * second request rather than trusting the 200 it just got.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names and copy throughout. The repo
 * is public.
