/**
 * Every doc belongs to a workspace (Bryan, 2026-08-13).
 *
 * The constraint that makes this non-trivial is the second half of the
 * decision: requiring a workspace must not add a step. "Bind a doc, send
 * Bryan the URL" in one call is the product, so a caller with no workspace in
 * hand gets one materialized for them rather than an error telling them to go
 * make one first.
 *
 * These go through the real HTTP routes on purpose — the route layer
 * hand-copies body fields into the doc-store call and nothing type-checks it,
 * which is exactly how `groups` was accepted and discarded.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
