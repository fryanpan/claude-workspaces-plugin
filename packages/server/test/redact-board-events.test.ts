/**
 * Visitor redaction for board events on the workspace SSE feed.
 *
 * The §3.3 visitor contract says a workspace-scope visitor sees transitions
 * with actor DISPLAY NAMES only — no actor ids. The ws:<id> doc enforces
 * that via projectTask; the SSE feed is the second door (the private-meta
 * lesson: redacting one transport and forgetting the long-lived other is how
 * leaks ship), so the same shape is asserted here on the payloads the stream
 * writes. It follows projectTask exactly, which is why the description now
 * rides along: it is in the synced ydoc, and a redaction that withholds
 * nothing is worse than none, because it reads as a guarantee.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names in the jordan@partner.example
 * register. The repo is public.
