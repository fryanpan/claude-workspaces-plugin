/**
 * The Sentry half of the monitoring ask: the DSN lives in server config on
 * the box — NOT in this public repo — and reaches the browser through meta
 * tags in the served shells. The client only loads the Sentry SDK when the
 * shell emits the loader script, so an unconfigured install (every test,
 * every stranger's clone) ships zero Sentry bytes and makes zero external
 * requests.
 *
 * Four surfaces, not one. Until this suite grew, only `/workspaces/<id>`
 * carried the tag, so every transaction Sentry held was a board and "how
 * long does a doc take to open" had no answer at all. Each page type is
 * asserted separately and by NAME, because the whole point of the tag is to
 * group by it — a shell that carried the DSN but no page type would look
 * instrumented and still be uncomparable.
 *
 * Every DSN below is fictional and every fixture synthetic.
