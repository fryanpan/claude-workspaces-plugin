/**
 * A parked doc says WHY, on a surface its owner has.
 *
 * When a bound file stops answering, the doc comes back from its `.ydoc` with
 * no binding. That is the right outcome — nothing overwrites bytes we could
 * not read — but until now it was invisible: `syncError` lives on the
 * BINDING, and the whole shape of a park is that no binding was made. So a
 * doc whose cloud-sync folder had stopped answering and a doc that was never
 * file-backed both reported `bound: false` with nothing to tell them apart,
 * and the only account of the park was a `console.warn` in a server log the
 * doc's owner does not read.
 *
 * `sourceParked` is that account, reported by `doc_status` and `get_doc`.
 *
 * The reason names the path it declined to open, so it follows the same rule
 * `syncError` and `sourceUrl` already do: host-machine paths are not
 * workspace content, and a share visitor does not get it.
 *
 * The board, the doc and the paths here are invented.
