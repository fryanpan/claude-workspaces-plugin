/**
 * The last three ways past the member boundary, and the two suspicions beside
 * them. Every one is a MEMBER of a real board doing something on it — the
 * gate has already said yes to the path — so none of these can be caught by a
 * unit test of a predicate. They are driven over HTTP against the real route
 * table for that reason.
 *
 *   A. A cross-reference names its target in the BODY, so no path check ever
 *      saw it. A member could point one of their own rows at a row, doc or
 *      thread on a board they were never given, and backlinks are computed
 *      per read — so the chip landed over there, written from outside.
 *   B. The Home read marker took the person from `?user=` and `author.name`,
 *      which is one member naming another and being served their queue.
 *   C. The chip surfaces that answer "what points at this?" span every
 *      workspace. Filtered on `GET /api/tasks/<id>/links` and NOT on the doc
 *      and thread spellings of the same question.
 *   D. A widget popup-token outranked the Cloudflare Access identity in
 *      `authorFor`, on the one surface where Access IS the identity.
 *   E. Retiring a board admits and revokes nobody. That was written down
 *      backwards; this pins what actually happens.
 *   F. A dependency edge LOOKS like A with no `Ref` around it — `after` and
 *      the `blockedBy` arm of `park` take task ids straight out of the body.
 *      It is not: the store refuses a cross-board edge to everybody, in one
 *      word that tells a foreign id and a made-up one apart from nothing.
 *      Both halves are pinned here, because the reason the transition gate's
 *      report is safe lives three modules from the route that sends it.
 *
 * Each suite carries its own positive control: the same call, inside the
 * member's own board, still working. A refusal test with no control passes
 * just as well when the route is broken for everybody.
