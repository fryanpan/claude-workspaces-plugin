/**
 * Status lives on the task's Activity tab; comments are for asks and replies.
 *
 * The owner's call (2026-08-29): "let's get status updates off the comment
 * feed and into the activity tab instead — there's too much crap in the
 * comments." Turn notes already reach the tab by themselves from the Stop
 * hook, and `post_status` carries a named milestone there. What had kept
 * status IN the comments was the skills: three passages told an agent to
 * post progress, milestones and the final report as task comments, and
 * agents did exactly that.
 *
 * Content assertions on the shipped SKILL.md files, in the style of
 * skills-declare-once.test.ts: peers install the FILE, so the file is what
 * gets pinned. Negative guards run over every shipped skill so the old
 * sentence cannot come back in a new one.
