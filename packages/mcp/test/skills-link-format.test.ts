/**
 * A link's format is decided by WHERE IT LANDS, and the skills have to agree
 * on that in one voice.
 *
 * The failure this pins, measured 2026-08-21: an agent posted a raw URL into a
 * board comment and was right to, by its own reading. `working-in-a-workspace`
 * said to use relative inline links in a workspace; `diff-review` said to hand
 * the URL over "as a bare URL on its own line" and `embedding-widget` said the
 * same about a mockup URL it had just told you to post as a REPLY. Neither of
 * the last two named a destination, so both read as universal, and the more
 * specific-sounding instruction won.
 *
 * Both spellings are correct — for different destinations. Terminal chat gets
 * a bare URL on its own line because chat autolinkers eat the trailing `)` of
 * a markdown link. A workspace surface renders markdown, so a raw URL there is
 * just an unreadable one. The bug was never the advice; it was advice stated
 * without its scope.
 *
 * Content assertions on shipped SKILL.md files, in the style of
 * skills-declare-once.test.ts — peers install the FILE, so the file is what
 * gets pinned. Every guard here runs over every shipped skill rather than a
 * listed few, so a skill added tomorrow is covered without an edit.
