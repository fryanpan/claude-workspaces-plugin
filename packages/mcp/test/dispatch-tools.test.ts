/**
 * `register_dispatch` / `close_dispatch` reach peers, and reach the right
 * routes.
 *
 * A tool declared in `mcp.ts` but never built into
 * `packages/plugin/mcp/index.js` is invisible to every peer, and a handler
 * pointed at the wrong verb or path fails only in a peer's session. The routes
 * themselves are covered end to end in
 * packages/server/test/dispatch-routes.test.ts.
 *
 * This file used to read the built bundle and assert the two tool names appear
 * in its text. A name in the bundle is not a reachable tool: it survives a
 * handler that was deleted and a route that was renamed under it. The harness
 * runs the committed bundle as a real MCP server against a recording stub, so
 * the declaration is what a client is handed and the verb and path are the
 * request the handler made.
