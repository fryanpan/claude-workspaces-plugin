/**
 * `set_goal_list` teaches the generated-id contract, and hands back the id.
 *
 * Two failures this guards, both of which have happened in this repo:
 *
 *  - **The handler drops the new field.** `created` is the ONLY place a caller
 *    learns the id of a band it just created — it never chose one. The MCP
 *    handler hand-copies fields out of the route response, which is exactly
 *    the layer that silently dropped `groups` once already: every layer under
 *    it reports success while the caller gets nothing usable back.
 *  - **The bundle.** Peers load the committed `packages/plugin/mcp/index.js`,
 *    not the source, and a tool description IS the deliverable when the change
 *    is "here is the new way to say this" — there is no behaviour to notice,
 *    so nothing else reports the miss.
 *
 * Both used to be checked by reading text: a slice of `mcp.ts` for the
 * declaration, and `BUNDLE.toContain('created: res.created')` for the forward.
 * The second is the weaker — it passes on a handler no client can reach, and
 * breaks on a rename that changes nothing. The harness runs the committed
 * bundle as a real MCP server, so a declaration is what `tools/list` returns
 * and a forward is what the caller is actually handed back.
