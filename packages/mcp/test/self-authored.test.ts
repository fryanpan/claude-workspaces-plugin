/**
 * A session must not receive its own comments back as channel events.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-24 by four sessions independently: post a comment with
 * `create_thread` / `post_reply`, and the resulting `thread.created` /
 * `thread.replied` frame comes straight back into the AUTHOR's own context as
 * a `<channel source="claude-workspaces" …>` block carrying the full body it
 * just wrote. The wake carries zero information and the cost scales with post
 * length, so a long review comment is thousands of wasted tokens.
 *
 * The board half of this rule already existed — `emitBoardChannelMessage` drops a
 * `task.*` / `decision.*` frame whose `actor.id` is this agent. The doc-shaped
 * half (`thread.*`) had no such gate, which is the defect.
 *
 * EVERY AMBIGUITY RESOLVES TOWARDS DELIVERING. A duplicated wake is a visible
 * annoyance; a dropped one is silence, and an agent cannot tell silence from
 * "nobody commented" — the exact failure class watches exist to close. So an
 * event whose author cannot be positively determined is forwarded.
