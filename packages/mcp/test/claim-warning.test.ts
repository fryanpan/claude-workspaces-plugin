/**
 * The queue names who is already on a row (#329) — this is the half that
 * says it AT THE MOMENT OF THE CLAIM.
 *
 * On 2026-08-17 two sessions each built a complete answer to one task and
 * neither could detect the other. The server now returns `ownerSession` and
 * `claimedBy` on every queue row, but a dispatcher only reads the queue once
 * and then transitions rows for the rest of the session — so the presence
 * read and the pickup decision are separated by however long the session
 * runs. `task_transition` to in-progress is where the collision actually
 * happens, and it said nothing.
 *
 * INFORMATIONAL, ALWAYS. Nothing here refuses a second taker: two agents on
 * one row is sometimes right, and that collision is what produced two designs
 * whose disagreement made the choice legible. What it must not be is
 * invisible.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic.

/**
 * Peers load `packages/plugin/mcp/index.js`, so a source-only change reaches

 *
 * It is also, since the source-shape sweep, the ONLY half. The wiring claims
 * that used to be made by slicing `case 'task_transition': {` out of the
 * concatenated source — that presence is read before the move and only on a
 * pickup, that the warning is additive, that nothing refuses on presence —
 * are all observable from outside: the order of the requests the bundle
 * makes, and the payload it answers with. A `toContain` over the handler text
 * could not tell a computed warning from a discarded one, could not see a
 * source edit that was never rebuilt, and went red on a rename that changed
 * nothing.
 *
 * It used to be four `BUNDLE.toContain(...)` assertions. Every one of them
 * would have passed on a bundle whose `claimNoticeFor` call was deleted, on a
 * warning built and then dropped on the floor, and on a description string no
 * client is ever handed — the literals survive all three. So it now runs the
 * bundle over stdio: the guidance is what `tools/list` returns, and the
 * warning is what a real `task_transition` answers with.
 *
 * The board must be one this session has attached to: `claimNoticeFor` reads
 * presence per attached board and answers silence otherwise (attachments.ts),
 * so `attach_agent` first is the flow, not ceremony.
