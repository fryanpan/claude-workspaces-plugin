/**
 * Every tool the server ADVERTISES has a handler, and the renamed ones still
 * answer to the names they had before.
 *
 * The registry declares tools in one array and the dispatch answers them in
 * domain handlers a thousand lines away, both by hand. Declaring without
 * dispatching ships a tool that is visible, callable, and answers "unknown
 * tool" — and nothing type-checks the pair, so it can only be found in the
 * field, by a peer, on a version that already shipped.
 *
 * DRIVEN, NOT GREPPED. This file used to build two sets out of the
 * concatenated source with a `name: 'x',` regex and a `case 'x': {` regex and
 * compare them. That is a proxy for the thing: it cannot see a dispatch arm
 * the formatter re-indented out of its `{4,6}` window, it counts a `case`
 * inside an unrelated switch as a tool, and — the failure that matters most
 * here — it says nothing at all about `packages/plugin/mcp/index.js`, which
 * is the artifact `.mcp.json` loads and a peer runs. A tool wired in the
 * source and never rebuilt reaches nobody, and the old form was green for it.
 *
 * So: boot the committed bundle over stdio, take the advertised list from
 * `tools/list`, and CALL each name. "Has a handler" stops being a regex match
 * and becomes the server not answering `unknown tool`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS NO LONGER CHECKS, said plainly. The old file also asserted the
 * other direction — a `case` arm for a name nothing declares, a tool
 * reachable by whoever wrote it and invisible to everyone else. MCP has no
 * introspection for that: `tools/list` is the only enumeration a client gets,
 * so an undeclared arm cannot be observed from outside except by guessing its
 * name. What is checked instead is the bounded set that direction was really
 * protecting — the deprecated aliases, which ARE answered and deliberately
 * not advertised — plus a control proving an unknown name is refused.
