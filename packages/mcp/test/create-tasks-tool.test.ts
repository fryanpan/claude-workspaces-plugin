/**
 * `create_tasks` is the canonical create, and what it learned reaches peers.
 *
 * Two things this guards, both of which have gone wrong here before:
 *
 *  - **The bundle.** `.mcp.json` loads the committed
 *    `packages/plugin/mcp/index.js`, not the source. A description edited in
 *    `mcp.ts` and never rebuilt is invisible to every peer — which is exactly
 *    how PR #69 shipped a schema change nobody received. A tool description IS
 *    the deliverable when the change is "steer the agent to the other verb":
 *    there is no behaviour to notice, so nothing else would report the miss.
 *  - **The forwarding.** The server routes are covered end to end
 *    (task-placement.test.ts), but nothing yet checked that the MCP handler
 *    passes `placement` on rather than dropping it — the same "one layer away
 *    from where it's consumed" failure as a route that accepts a param and
 *    discards it.
 *
 * Both were read out of files: a slice of `mcp.ts`, and
 * `BUNDLE.toContain('placement')` over the built artifact. The bundle half was
 * the weakest assertion in this package — the word `placement` is in that file
 * whether or not a single row is ever marked placed. The harness runs the
 * committed bundle as a real MCP server against a recording stub, so the
 * declaration is what a client is handed and the forwarding is what comes back
 * out of a real call. All fixtures are synthetic.
