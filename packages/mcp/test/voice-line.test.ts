/**
 * A `voice.request` row reaches every attached agent's channel. Until the
 * fast path could only NAVIGATE, exactly two things could be true of one: the
 * server answered it (a lookup — drop it, nothing happened), or it needs the
 * agent (render the imperative). The action route is a third thing, and it is
 * the one the old two-way rendering gets wrong in the dangerous direction: a
 * change that ALREADY LANDED on the board, described to the agent as work to
 * do. Re-applying "mark this done" is caught by same-status; re-applying an
 * assignee change or a spoken comment is not — the second one posts the same
 * words twice under the speaker's name.
