/**
 * The propagation clause on `decision.answered`, and the wiring that carries
 * it to an agent.
 *
 * The behaviour is proven against REAL emitted rows in
 * `packages/server/test/decision-answered-line.test.ts` — that is the test
 * that can tell `links` from a key nobody sends. What this file adds is the
 * two seams that suite cannot see: the switch in mcp.ts must actually call
 * this renderer rather than rebuild the sentence inline (which is how the
 * unconditional clause survived in the first place), and the BUNDLE must carry
 * the guard, because peers load `packages/plugin/mcp/index.js` and never the
 * source.
 *
 * The bundle half used to be `BUNDLE.toContain('Array.isArray(p.links) && …')`.
 * A minifier that spelt the same test differently would have failed it, and a
 * guard whose result was thrown away would have passed it. It now pushes both
 * shapes of the frame down the running bundle's event stream and reads the
 * sentence a session receives.
