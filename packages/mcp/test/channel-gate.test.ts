/**
 * A bot meeting's live transcript must never wake the agent.
 *
 * `meeting.transcript` frames are transient (no `eid`), so the dedup has no
 * key and forwards every one — which is exactly what happened: 11 vendor
 * frames, 11 channel notifications, before this gate existed. The first two
 * describes compose the two decisions `handleFrame` makes, in its order, with
 * a real dedup instance, so the assertion is on the forward path's own
 * verdict and not on a lookalike predicate.
 *
 * The last describe is the delivery half, and it used to be
 * `BUNDLE.toContain('startsWith("meeting.")')`. That literal survives a gate
 * whose caller was deleted, survives a gate that runs AFTER the dedup, and
 * dies on a rename that keeps the feature working — so it could not tell a
 * shipped gate from a shipped string. It now runs the committed bundle over
 * stdio, pushes real frames down its event stream, and counts the channel
 * lines a session would have read.

 * The thread frame is the load-bearing control and is pushed LAST. The mux
 * loop delivers frames in order and awaits each one, so a thread line on
 * stdout proves every meeting frame ahead of it was already handled — which
 * is what makes "no meeting line" an absence rather than a race.
