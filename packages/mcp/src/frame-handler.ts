/**
 * One raw SSE frame in, at most one channel message and one receipt out.
 *
 * Lifted out of `mcp.ts` unchanged so it can be driven directly: that file
 * starts an MCP server on import, which put the parse, the gap notice, the
 * kind gate, the dedup and the comment receipt out of reach of everything but
 * a spawned bundle.
 *
 * The ORDER here is the load-bearing part and the reason it is worth its own
 * module. The kind gate runs before the dedup, so a word-rate frame never
 * reaches the dedup window. The receipt runs after the forward attempt and
 * OUTSIDE the dedup gate, so a redelivered frame is still acknowledged while
 * being hidden from the session.
