 *   1. $FEEDBACK_BASE_URL — explicit override
 *   2. ~/.claude/live-feedback/server.json — written by scripts/serve.ts
 *      on startup so the MCP auto-finds whichever port the server landed on
 *   3. http://localhost:8787 — last-resort default
 *
 * env:
 *   FEEDBACK_BASE_URL    — optional override; usually discovery handles it
 *   FEEDBACK_AGENT_NAME  — this agent's display name (e.g. "Quick Build");
 *                          wins over FEEDBACK_AUTHOR, which the plugin's
 *                          .mcp.json pins to `agent` for every peer
 *   FEEDBACK_AUTHOR      — fallback author key/name (default: agent)

        "Create a GitHub-PR-style review of a git diff: point it at a local repo and a base ref, and the server creates one review doc per changed file, grouped as a workspace — the reviewer gets a file tree with per-file A/M/D/R + line-count badges, a unified diff view with old/new line numbers and collapsed unchanged regions, a per-file Diff ↔ whole-File toggle, and line-anchored comment threads in both views. DEFAULT MODE (no `target`): diff base → the WORKING TREE, i.e. the folder as it is right now, uncommitted edits and untracked files included. The docs bind to the live files on disk, so as you keep editing the code the reviewer's diff re-renders within ~1s — this is the live-loop mode. Comments stay anchored to their lines through edits (snippet-based auto-reanchor); if an anchored line disappears, the thread lands in the existing Orphaned/outdated section where the reviewer can re-anchor it. Once the review EXISTS, prefer refresh_workspace(reviewId) over re-running this tool: it re-reads the diff from the stored base (no need to remember the ref), picks up files that changed since, and flags members whose change was reverted — all without re-minting a docId. Re-running this tool is still idempotent (same docIds, threads survive). PINNED MODE (pass `target`): content is frozen at the target commit; anchors can never drift; same reviewId with a different range is rejected. `repo` is an absolute path to a local checkout/worktree; `base`/`target` are any refs git can resolve (hashes, branches, HEAD~2). Binary files and files over 512 KB are skipped and reported in skipped[]. Pass `exclude` (path prefixes, e.g. ['src/main/assets/vendored-repo']) to keep vendored or generated directories out of the review. GUARDRAIL: more than `maxFiles` (default 300) changed files → error 'too-many-files'; narrow with `exclude` or raise `maxFiles`. The caller is auto-subscribed to thread events on every file doc (pass subscribe:false to skip). Returns {reviewId, hubWorkspaceId, entryUrl, files[{docId, relPath, status, additions, deletions, reviewUrl}], skipped[]} — `hubWorkspaceId` is the board the whole review was filed on as ONE row, so a reviewer can find it without the URL — hand `entryUrl` to the human (the file tree navigates to the rest).

Its guardrail counts OPEN TASKS, not threads: without force it refuses with error:'has-open-tasks' and openTasks:<count>, so finish or close them first, or pass force:true.

Use this instead of re-running create_diff_review / bind_folder when the review already exists and the files have moved under it. For a DIFF REVIEW it re-runs the diff from the stored base, so files you changed after creating the review join it and per-file status/line counts refresh; a member whose change you reverted is marked stale rather than deleted (its comments are still someone's feedback, and the change may come back). For a BROWSE workspace members bind lazily, so what refresh adds is the reverse sweep: members whose file was deleted or renamed away get marked stale. Stale is always reversible — the next refresh that finds the file clears it and lists it under restored. PINNED diff reviews (created with a `target`) are refused with error:'pinned': their content is a commit, so there is nothing to re-read. The review's bind-time `exclude`, `groups` and `maxFiles` are replayed automatically, so a refresh never widens the scope you set or scatters new files into heuristic buckets. Returns {ok, kind:'diff'|'browse', added[], stale[{docId, relPath, openThreads}], restored[], fileCount}. Read `stale` after a rename: those threads are now stranded on a file nobody will open, so re-anchor or resolve them. Errors: 'too-many-files' (the review outgrew its cap — re-run the bind with a higher maxFiles, or narrow it with exclude), 'not-found' (nothing bound under that id — including a folder that was bound while EMPTY, which creates no docs; re-run bind_folder, it derives the same workspaceId so shares and threads survive), 'root-missing' (the folder itself is gone).",

Each row carries its FULL description, which is what tells you whether two tasks touch the same code and therefore have to be sequenced; that judgment is made from the text, not from a field.

That is where a previous reader wrote down what they found when they reproduced it: five times in one week a task claimed something was missing that had already shipped, twice within hours of the task being filed, and each time the correction existed as a comment nobody on the pickup path could see. Read the notes first — they may already have done the reproducing for you, and they routinely change the SIZE of the work. `premise` says NOTHING about whether the task is done; it never appears on a done task, and most rows carrying it still have real work left. It clears itself when the description is rewritten (update_task_body), which is the right move once you know what is actually true — attribute and date the correction, and keep what the body originally claimed, since the original measurement is evidence about when it was taken rather than a mistake to erase.',

To KEEP a band, send its `id` exactly as get_workspace reports it.

An order that omits, repeats or invents an id is REFUSED with 400 naming the offending ids, so a list that another writer has changed since you read it makes you re-read rather than silently dropping a goal — which is exactly what set_goal_list does with the same mistake (its omissions dump that goal\'s open tasks into Chores). Get the ids from get_workspace and send back every row at your scope whose `reorderable` is true — that one filter is the whole rule, and it covers both kinds of row that are marked false (Chores, and a goal id left behind on a done task). Including either is a 400: `chores` comes back in `reservedIds` because it is a permanent bucket you simply drop, an orphaned id comes back in `unknownIds` because the goal really was removed.
