/**
 * The board half of the dispatch: tasks, goals, review items and the links
 * between them.
 *
 * Creating and rewriting rows, moving them through their statuses, placing
 * them in goal bands, and the whole review-item family — filing a question,
 * answering it, revising it, withdrawing it, asking for more. What holds it
 * together is that every arm addresses a TASK, by `taskId` or by a
 * `reviewItemId` that resolves to one, and every reply is trimmed to ids and
 * status rather than echoing the row the caller just wrote.
 *
 * Four helpers came with the arms because nothing else reads them:
 * `TaskPayload` (the fields the trimmed results pick out of the wire object),
 * `taskCreatedSummary`, `heldResult` — the quality gate's verdict, spelled
 * once for both doors that can be held — and the two lookups that make a
 * bare `reviewItemId` a universal address.
 *
 * Dependencies arrive in an explicit context rather than captured from
 * `mcp.ts`, following `routes/task-routes-context.ts` in the server. The two
 * helpers that call the server take that context as their first argument;
 * they used to close over the entry point's `http` and `AUTHOR`, and that is
 * the only line of moved code the split rewrote.
 *
 * The handler answers `undefined` for a name it does not know. Every arm is
 * the code that stood in the switch, moved with its comments and dedented one
 * level; no tool's arguments, behaviour or reply changed here.
