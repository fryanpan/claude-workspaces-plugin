/**
 * The board-and-machine half of the dispatch: everything addressed to a
 * WORKSPACE rather than to a document or a row in it.
 *
 * Minting, renaming and retiring a board; the lead seat; what a board looks
 * like from outside (`get_workspace`); the agent's own attachment, heartbeat
 * and dispatch registrations; and the operator verbs a session runs on the
 * machine rather than on the work — the parallelism cap, the chat audit, the
 * plugin-cache refresh.
 *
 * `setBoardRetired` came with the arms: `archive_workspace` and
 * `unretire_workspace` are one route call with the boolean flipped, and they
 * stay two `case` blocks rather than one fall-through because that is the
 * shape `tool-wiring.test.ts` reads to prove no advertised tool is unhandled.
 *
 * Dependencies arrive in an explicit context rather than captured from
 * `mcp.ts`, following `routes/task-routes-context.ts` in the server.
 * `PLUGIN_VERSION` is read from that context rather than re-spelled here:
 * it stays defined in `mcp.ts`, which is the handshake literal's one site and
 * one of the three the release checklist keeps in step.
 *
 * The handler answers `undefined` for a name it does not know. Every arm is
 * the code that stood in the switch, moved with its comments and dedented one
 * level; no tool's arguments, behaviour or reply changed here.
