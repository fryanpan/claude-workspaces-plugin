/**
 * WHO IS ALREADY ON THIS ROW, said at the moment of the claim.
 *
 * The queue route learned to carry `ownerSession` and `claimedBy` on every
 * row (#329), which fixed the read. It did not fix the TIMING: a dispatcher
 * reads the queue once and then transitions rows for the rest of the session,
 * so the presence read and the pickup decision are separated by however long
 * that session runs. `task_transition` to in-progress is where the collision
 * actually happens — on 2026-08-17 two sessions each built a complete answer
 * to one task with neither able to detect the other — and it was the one
 * surface that said nothing.
 *
 * INFORMATIONAL, ALWAYS, AND IT SAYS SO. Nothing here refuses a second taker.
 * Two agents on one row is sometimes right; that same collision produced two
 * designs whose disagreement made the choice legible. The failure is not the
 * overlap, it is the overlap nobody could see. A warning that reads like a
 * gate would be worse than silence, because the next agent would drop work it
 * was allowed to do — hence the sentence that stays in every rendering.
 *
 * A RECENCY READ, NEVER CONTENT IDENTITY. A session that thinks for an hour
 * produces no new commit and still holds the row, which is what a
 * sha-comparing guard gets wrong. The only question asked here is whether the
 * server has heard from that session lately.
 *
 * Kept out of mcp.ts — a bundle entry point that exports nothing — for the
 * same reason `nudge-line.ts` and `voice-line.ts` are: the wording is a
 * decision, and inline in a 3,000-line switch it cannot be asserted.
