/**
 * Resolve this MCP process's author identity from env.
 *
 * `CW_AGENT_NAME` (set per-peer in the agent's own environment) wins over
 * `CW_AUTHOR`, because the plugin's `.mcp.json` pins `CW_AUTHOR=agent` for
 * every peer — without the override var, all agents in a fleet collapse into
 * one shared "Agent" identity. Any name that isn't a known user synthesizes a
 * stable identity: same name → same id and color everywhere, so attribution
 * matches across docs and sessions.
 *
 * Both variables are read through `readRenamedEnv`, so the pre-rename
 * `FEEDBACK_AGENT_NAME` / `FEEDBACK_AUTHOR` keep working. That fallback
 * matters more here than anywhere else: these are read ONCE from the
 * session's launch environment, so a peer whose launcher config the rollout
 * sweep missed cannot pick up the new name without a full restart — and the
 * failure would be silent, collapsing that agent into the shared "agent"
 * identity the override exists to prevent.
