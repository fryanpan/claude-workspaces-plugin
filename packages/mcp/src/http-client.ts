 * that file starts an MCP server on import, so the discovery fallback and the
 * status-before-parse order could only ever be read, never run.
 *
 * Both of those exist because of a specific failure. Discovery is resolved
 * PER REQUEST, not frozen at module load: the MCP stdio child runs for the
 * life of a session — sometimes days — and the supervisor may not be running
 * at child-start, may move ports on restart, or may not have written its
 * discovery file yet. And the status is checked BEFORE the body is parsed,
 * because the server's catch-all answers unmatched routes with the bare
 * string `not found`, which explodes `JSON.parse` and buries the HTTP error
 * that was the actual news.
