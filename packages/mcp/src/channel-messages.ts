 * could import these and why the wording of every channel line went untested
 * except through a spawned bundle or a regex over the source. Everything the
 * renderers touch outside their own payload is passed in: the notification
 * sink, the HTTP client, this session's identity, and the clock.
 *
 * `emitChannelMessage` is the entry point. Board families (`task.`, `decision.`,
 * `workspace.`, `agent.`, `voice.`) go to `emitBoardChannelMessage`; everything
