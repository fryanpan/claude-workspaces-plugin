/**
 * A schedule rule written as ENGLISH — the half of the phrase editor that
 * turns a `ScheduleRule` back into the sentence somebody typed.
 *
 * The editor shows one rule two ways: a phrase you type, and chips you can
 * click. Bryan's condition on the approved mock was that neither is the
 * source — *"the phrase and the chips are two views of ONE rule"* — so
 * editing a chip has to rewrite the phrase, and a new phrase has to
 * re-derive the chips. That only works if the writer here and the parser in
 * `schedule-phrase-parse.ts` agree, which is what the round-trip tests
 * assert: for every phrase the parser accepts, writing the rule it produced
 * and parsing THAT gives the same rule back.
 *
 * It lives in `core` beside `task-schedule.ts` for the reason that file
 * gives: a second spelling of "every weekday at 9" anywhere else would be a
 * second answer to when a row is owed. The chips are drawn from these same
 * labels, so a chip can never read differently from the phrase it stands for.
 *
 * ── Canonical forms ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   once              `Sep 10 at 3pm`            (+ year when it is not this
 *                                                 year, or is in the past)
 *   calendar          `every day at 9am and 5pm`
 *                     `every weekday at 9am`
 *                     `every Monday and Thursday at 9am`
 *   every (interval)  `every 20 minutes`  `every 2 hours`  `every week`
 *   after-completion  `3 days after it's done`
 *   end               ` until Dec`  ` until Dec 15`
 *   missed-run policy `, skip if missed`         (the default, catch up, is
 *                                                 never written)
 *
 * **An interval rule never says "day".** `every` is a fixed number of
 * milliseconds and `calendar` is a wall clock, and "every day" has to mean
 * the second one — so one day of interval writes as `every 24 hours`. The
 * parser still ACCEPTS "every 3 days" (it is what a person types); it just
 * canonicalises to hours or weeks, which is also the honest reading, because
 * an interval rule really does drift an hour across a daylight-saving change.
