 * for a stored secret payload, so `readReviewPayload` returns undefined, so
 * the comment carrying it stays an ordinary comment the dock never sees as an
 * ask. Dropping the ask is the safe direction — there is no state in which
 * that bundle renders a secret ask with its owner-only flag missing, because
 * there is no state in which it renders one.
 *
 * Deleted rather than flipped because Bun's minifier does not fold a constant
 * into the branch that reads it — measured: flipping this to `false` left
 * both branches, the call and the module they reach in the bundle, 28 bytes

 * `detail` here answers the two obligations the removal created with one
 * mechanism: an old bundle's write keeps every word its author typed, and the
