/**
 * The occurrence arithmetic, driven directly. Criterion 2 of the scheduler
 * ticket lives here: fixed-cadence and after-completion rules produce the
 * right next occurrence, and the day math survives a DST transition.
 *
 * Every instant is a literal rather than something derived from the wall
 * clock: these functions are pure, so a test that computed its own expected
 * answer would be asserting the implementation against itself.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
