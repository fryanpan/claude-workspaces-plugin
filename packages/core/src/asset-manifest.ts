/**
 * Content-addressed names for the assets an HTML shell loads.
 *
 * The entry bundles used to live at permanent URLs — `/app/app.js`,
 * `/app/board.js` — and the only thing standing between a tab and last week's
 * code was `Cache-Control: no-cache`, which is a REQUEST to revalidate, not a
 * guarantee. When a browser declined to revalidate (iOS Safari, and a Home
 * Screen web app most of all, which keeps its own cache partition), the tab
 * reloaded straight back onto the bundle it was already running. The stale
 * banner then reappeared on every reload, correctly: the tab really was still
 * old, and reloading it did not change that.
 *
 * A content-addressed name removes the browser from the decision. New bytes
 * get a new URL, and a URL a cache has never seen cannot be answered from it.
 * The shell that names the URL is what must stay fresh — `no-store` — and it
 * is two kilobytes.
 *
 * Node-only (`node:crypto`), and deliberately NOT re-exported from
 * `@claude-workspaces/core`'s index: the build script and the server import it, and
 * pulling it into the browser bundle's import graph would be a regression all
 * of its own.

 * its own schedule — so hashing its name would orphan every existing
 * registration on every deploy. It is also the one asset browsers already
 * refuse to serve from cache for longer than a day.
