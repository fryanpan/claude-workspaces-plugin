/**
 * The Review Item CONTRACT: every shape a declaration, its answer, its
 * revisions and its verdict are stored in, and nothing that acts on them.
 *
 * The verbs live in `review-item.ts`, the quality gate in
 * `review-item-check.ts`, the defensive readers in `review-item-wire.ts` —
 * and all three are written in terms of these types. They were declared
 * alongside the verbs until this split, which meant the gate and the readers
 * imported the module that imports THEM: a cycle that only stayed harmless
 * because a type-only import erases at build time.
 *
 * Types only, on purpose. This file emits no JavaScript, so a module may
 * depend on the contract without depending on anything that runs; the
 * runtime surface is unchanged because `review-item.ts` re-exports every
 * name below, and `packages/core/src/index.ts` re-exports that.

 * last two: *"The last two are roughly the same thing."* He also gave them one
 * spec: a markdown summary under 150 words, inline links where needed, and one
 * open-ended markdown answer. So they differ in what the author puts in the
 * summary (an excerpt, or a link), not in anything this module, the API or the
 * card would do differently.
 *
 * Splitting them anyway would add a discriminator that changes no behaviour —
 * a second spelling of one value, which this codebase has already been bitten
 * by (see "A second spelling for the same value makes accidental duplicates
 * reachable" in docs/process/learnings.md). If a mockup later needs its own
