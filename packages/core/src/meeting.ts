/**
 * The live-meeting wire contract, shared by the browser capture and the

 *
 * WHY AUDIO GETS ITS OWN SOCKET AND THE WORDS COME BACK DOWN IT. Doc events
 * already have a push channel — the SSE bus — but it keeps a replay buffer
 * of the last 200 events per channel so a reconnecting client can catch up.
 * A word-by-word transcript emits at conversational speed, which would evict
 * every real doc event from that buffer within a minute of a meeting. So the
 * transcript rides back down the same socket the audio went up: the client
 * that opened the mic is the one rendering the strip, nothing else needs the
 * partials, and no shared buffer is thrashed. Only the low-rate lifecycle
 * facts — a meeting started, a meeting stopped — go out over SSE, where
 * other viewers of the doc can see that recording is live.
 *
 * WHY THE SOCKET IS THE LIFECYCLE. Opening this socket starts the meeting and
 * closing it stops the meeting. A separate REST start/stop would introduce a
 * state the two halves can disagree about — a meeting marked live whose audio
 * socket never connected, or a socket streaming into a meeting the server
 * thinks ended. There is one fact here and one owner of it.
