/**
 * Per-mention speaker attribution inside composed meeting notes.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS FIXES. Until now the notes carried who-said-what only as
 * PROSE: the composer wrote the words "Speaker B" and a rename found them by
 * searching for that string. Two consequences, both in the architecture
 * summary as known limits — a rename could not tell two voices apart when
 * they had been given the same name ("Alice" in the notes does not say
 * which), and nothing else in the system could ever ask a note who said it,
 * because the answer existed only as English.
 *
 * THE TAG IS A MARKDOWN LINK, and that is the whole trick:
 *
 *     - [@Mallory](speaker:B) wants the deploy gate moved before merge.
 *
 * The visible half is the name; the durable half is the LABEL, in the href.
 * Everything follows from that split:
 *
 * - **It survives the round trip.** A meeting doc is a live Yjs doc that
 *   serializes to a .md file on disk. A link is ordinary markdown and an
 *   ordinary Yjs `link` mark, so the attribution goes to disk, comes back
 *   from disk, and is carried through an edit the same way bold is. A mark
 *   invented for this would have been lost on the first flush.
 * - **A rename touches the NAME, never the identity.** Naming "B" as Mallory
 *   rewrites the link text at every site whose href is `speaker:B` — no
 *   string search, so two voices called Alice are still two voices and each
 *   renames alone. The ambiguity that used to refuse the retroactive rewrite
 *   cannot arise for a tagged mention.
 * - **Reassignment is one attribute.** Moving a turn diarization gave to the
 *   wrong voice is a change of href, in place, and the words never move.
 *
 * THE HREF ALSO SAYS WHERE THE WORDS CAME FROM — `speaker:B?t=10,12`. A
 * rename is a fact about a VOICE and the label answers it; the engine's own
 * late correction is a fact about a TURN ("turn 12 was not B after all"), and
 * a bare label cannot say which of B's sentences a mention was written from.
 * So the tick stamps each mention it composes with that voice's turns in it,
 * and `reattributeSpeakerTags` moves exactly the mentions whose every turn
 * moved the same way — marking the ones it cannot place rather than guessing.
 * A mention a PERSON reassigned carries no provenance, which is what keeps a
 * later engine pass off an answer a human already gave.
 *
 * A TAG IS NOT EVIDENCE, IT IS A CLAIM THE MODEL MAKES. The composer is an
 * LLM, so `normalizeSpeakerTags` is the deterministic gate every composed
 * section passes through before it reaches a doc: a tag naming a voice the
 * meeting never carried is DROPPED — name and all — and a tag naming a real
 * one is re-rendered from the name map rather than trusted to spell it. Same
 * law the task capture's `requester` is held to — a model-claimed
 * attribution must name something the tick's own transcript contained.
 *
 * Dropping the name rather than merely the link is the whole point of the
 * gate, and it took a real meeting to learn it: unwrapping left the words
 * behind, so a solo huddle came out of the pass reading "Speaker A: ..." and
 * "Speaker B: ..." with the tags gone and the two invented people still in
 * the notes. A gate that removes the machine-readable half of a false claim
 * and keeps the half a person reads has removed nothing.
 *
 * Pure string work, in core, because three processes need to agree about it:
 * the server composes and renames, the editor renders the chip, and the
 * markdown on disk is what a person reads when neither is running.

 *
 * A `SpeakerRevision` names TURNS, and a mention names a VOICE, so the join
 * is the provenance stamped in the href. For each tagged mention, every turn
 * behind it is asked what it is attributed to now — a revised turn answers
 * with its new label, an untouched one answers with the label it already
 * had, which is the mention's own:
 *
 *  - **They all agree on a different voice** → the mention moves. Every turn
 *    that could have produced these words belongs to that voice now, so the
 *    attribution is not a guess.
 *  - **They all agree on nobody** → the claim comes off, name included, and
 *    the note's own words stay — the same remedy `normalizeSpeakerTags`
 *    gives a voice the meeting never carried. Saying "Speaker B" of speech
 *    the engine has withdrawn from B is the one outcome worse than saying
 *    nothing, and leaving the words "Speaker B" behind after taking the tag
 *    off says it just as loudly.
 *  - **They disagree** → the mention is marked unsure. Half its turns moved
 *    and half did not, so it belongs to one of two voices and the notes do
 *    not record which. A coin flip would put a name against words somebody
 *    else said; silence would hide that the meeting no longer stands behind
 *    the name already there.
 *  - **No provenance, or no turn behind it was revised** → untouched. That
 *    covers every tag written before this parameter existed and, on purpose,
 *    every mention a PERSON has reassigned: their answer is written bare, so
 *    no later engine pass revisits it.
