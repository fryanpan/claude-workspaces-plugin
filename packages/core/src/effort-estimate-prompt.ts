/**
 * The effort-estimate scorer's pure half: the default prompt, the request
 * built from it, and the parser for the model's reply.
 *
 * Pure for the same reason `review-judge-prompt.ts` is — the network half
 * lives in the server (`effort-estimator.ts`), so the wording of the ask
 * and the shape of the answer can be asserted without a key or a socket.
 *
 * Bryan wants to look at a goal on the board and see roughly when it will
 * finish, instead of asking an agent. That needs two numbers, because they
 * move independently: WALL-CLOCK time (filed to done, including whatever
 * it spends waiting on review or a decision) and HANDS-ON time (his own —
 * reading, reviewing, deciding, testing). Calibrating either against what
 * actually happened is a later chunk; this one only produces the guess and
 * says clearly when it could not.
 *
 * **The baseline is agent-executed work, and that is the whole point of
 * version 2.** Version 1 asked the question with no baseline at all, and a
 * model with no baseline answers with the one from its training data: a
 * person doing the work. It scored one ticket on the live board at 30 days
 * hands-on over 60 days of calendar time — 98% of that goal's whole
 * remainder, from a row an agent finished inside a week — and the board
 * printed the goal as 15.5 days of Bryan's own attention finishing some
 * time between October and December. The rows the board had already closed
 * said otherwise: nine of them ran at a median 0.099 of their estimated
 * calendar time and five at 0.010 of their estimated hands-on time.
 *
 * So the prompt now says who does the work, and the ceiling is fourteen
 * days rather than ninety. Both halves matter and neither is enough alone:
 * a stated baseline the model may still overshoot, and a ceiling that
 * turns an overshoot into a REFUSAL — a failed run visible on the row —
 * rather than a number nobody would stand behind being summed into a goal.
 */

/**
 * Bumped when the frame around the prompt changes, so a stored estimate can
 * be told from one made under an older ask.
 *
 * It is not a label. Two things read it: the boot pass that re-scores every
 * open ticket whose estimate predates the current ask (`server.ts`), and
 * the calibrator, which will only learn a correction factor from estimates
 * made under the CURRENT generation (`goal-effort.ts`). A ratio learned
 * against version 1's human-scaled numbers, applied to version 2's
 * agent-scaled ones, would discount the same speed-up twice.
 *
 * 2 — agent-executed baseline, 14-day ceiling (2026-08-30).
