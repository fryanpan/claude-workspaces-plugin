/**
 * Stage timing for the live meeting pipeline: how long a spoken word takes to
 * become a word on the screen, and which hop spent it.
 *
 * THE READOUT IS OFF UNLESS ASKED; THE LEDGER IS NOT. The strip turns the
 * readout on with `?timing=1`, which puts `timing: true` on the `start` frame,
 * and a server that was not asked attaches no timing block — the wire is
 * unchanged, which is the property that let this flag live in the shipped
 * client and be measured on PROD against a real conversation rather than a
 * harness.
 *
 * `AudioChunkLedger` no longer waits for that flag. A second reader wants it
 * and cannot be an opt-in: the notes pipeline resolves a word's audio offset
 * back to the instant it was SPOKEN, and a latency number that only exists on
 * instrumented meetings is not a claim about ordinary ones. The ring is four
 * numbers a chunk, bounded at about two minutes, in memory, never serialized
 * — so what "costs nothing when off" now means is that nothing reaches the
 * client, not that nothing is allocated. Its arithmetic is only valid while
 * one stream feeds it; the relay's `ledgerTrusted` is where that is tracked.
 *
 * TIMINGS ONLY, NEVER CONTENT. Every field below is a number. No transcript
 * text, no doc id, no title, no path crosses this module, and the CSV it
 * writes has no column that could carry one. The population being sampled is
 * "the last word of a transcript frame", identified by its AUDIO OFFSET —
 * never by what the word was.
 *
 * WHY THE AUDIO OFFSET IS THE CORRELATION KEY. Audio goes up as raw PCM with
 * no sequence number in it, so there is nothing in a frame to echo back. But
 * the engine reports every word with `start`/`end` in milliseconds of the
 * audio stream, and the server knows exactly how many bytes it had forwarded
 * when it forwarded each chunk — so a word's audio offset names the chunk
 * that carried it, arithmetically, with nothing added to the wire. Correlating
 * on the text instead would break on the very thing this pipeline exists to
 * do: revise a word after it is already on screen.
 *
 * THE ONE ASSUMPTION, stated so it can be checked. The engine counts audio
 * milliseconds from the start of ITS stream; we count from the first byte we
 * forwarded. Those origins coincide because the relay forwards its handshake
 * buffer before anything else and never drops a chunk. The CSV keeps the raw
 * marks, so a systematic offset between the two would show up as a constant
 * added to the vendor leg rather than hiding.
 *
 * CLOCK SKEW, AND WHAT SURVIVES IT. The browser and the server keep separate
 * clocks, so the two network legs are estimated through an NTP-style exchange
 * (`estimateClockOffset`). An error in that estimate moves time BETWEEN
 * uplink and downlink and cancels in their sum — so `total`, `network`, every
 * server-internal leg and the vendor leg are exact regardless, and only the
 * up/down SPLIT depends on the estimate. Read the split as indicative and the
 * rest as measured.
