 * Is this ask telling the READER to go and perceive something?

 * coverage — the cost asymmetry runs the other way from most checks. A false
 * positive spends one sentence in a tool result. A false NEGATIVE is Bryan
 * hunting for a link, which is the whole reason this exists. But advice that
 * fires on asks with nothing to link is worse than either: it trains agents
 * to skim past the channel, and then the true positives stop landing too.
 * So this is tuned to be quiet and right, not thorough.
 *
 * 1. The verb is in its BASE form. "Read the draft" is a directive; "I read
 *    the draft", "reviewed", "checking" are reports about work already done,
 *    and a report is the commonest way one of these words appears in a
 *    detail that needs no link at all. `\b` after the stem does this for
 *    free: "looked", "reviews" and "checking" have no boundary there.
 *
 * 2. The verb sits where a request sits — opening a sentence, a line or a
 *    bullet, or following an explicit request marker ("please", "can you",
 *    "take a"). A verb buried mid-clause is almost always narration.
 *
 * 3. It TAKES AN OBJECT: the next word introduces one, being a determiner, a
 *    pronoun, a possessive or a preposition. Position alone is not enough,
 *    because every word in the list above is also a noun or an adjective and
 *    card titles are written as noun phrases — "Open question: what should we
 *    call it?", "Review complete", "Test results" all opened with a listed
 *    word and all were advised to add a link to an artifact that does not
 *    exist (codex review). A noun use is followed by another noun; a
 *    directive is followed by the thing it directs you at.
 *
 * What it deliberately misses: an ask that implies a target without naming
 * the act ("thoughts on the new nav?"). Catching those means guessing, and
 * guessing fires on every open question — the "what should we call it?"
 * family, which is complete with nothing to link. A decision whose options
 * are described in full carries no directive either, and is silent here by
 * construction rather than by a special case.

 * Is this payload shaped like something a person can act on from a phone?

 * Two tiers, and the line between them is the one thing this module has to get
 * right. `decision-shape.ts` already learned it for decision task bodies: a
 * gate that demands everything makes filing a chore, and the predictable
 * response to a chore is to route around it — there, by filing the decision as
 * an action instead. So only what the ROW is made of refuses.
 *
 * - **Refused**: a missing `headline`, a line break inside it, a `decision`
 *   with fewer than two options, and anything past a sanity ceiling
 *   (`lineMaxChars` for the row field, `detailMaxWords` for a body). These are
 *   structural: the row cannot be built at all without them, and a ceiling is
 *   only ever reached by a pasted document. Note it refuses rather than
 *   truncating — clipping a headline is precisely how the title went back to
 *   being a sentence cut in half, and the author would never learn.
 * - **Advised**: a missing `detail`, and any LENGTH over a budget. Both make
 *   the card thinner or wider than it wants to be; neither makes it
 *   unreadable. Demanding another field for a two-word question is the chore
 *   that gets routed around, and so is bouncing a filing to shave two words
 *   off a row line — measured, six times in one day. So is a `detail` that
 *   carries no link while the comment beside it does: the ask is filed and
 *   answerable, it is only the reader's route to the work that is missing.
 *
 * `context.text` is the comment the declaration rode in on, when there was
 * one. It is the only reason this function can tell a self-contained card
 * from one whose links stayed behind in the comment; a ticket-borne item
 * passes none and is judged on the payload alone.
 *
 * As of 2026-08-25 there is exactly ONE required field, because there is
 * exactly one field the row is made of. A payload still carrying the retired
 * `why` / `lookFor` passes untouched: unknown keys were never refused, and an
 * unrestarted caller must not get a 400 from a rule it cannot know about.
 * Their text is not discarded either — `readReviewPayload` folds it into the
 * body on the way to storage.
 *
 * Every check is one-directional in the same sense as `checkDecisionShape`:
 * counting words can undercount a field somebody wrote well (a false gap, i.e.
 * noise on a good payload), never pass a field that is absent.
