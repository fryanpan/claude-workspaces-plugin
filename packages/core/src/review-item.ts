/**
 * A Review Item — the thing an agent DECLARES when it needs a person, as
 * opposed to the thing a server INFERS from prose.
 *
 * The queue this replaces asked "is the newest comment an agent's", which is
 * exactly what a finished exchange looks like: a person comments, an agent
 * fixes it, the agent replies "Done — shipped in #226", and nobody types
 * again. So the queue accumulated one permanent row per thing the agents got
 * RIGHT. Measured on this project's board 2026-08-18: 105 rows, 0 of them
 * decisions, 6 containing a question, 62 opening with a closing verb, and 93
 * of the 105 row TITLES clipped mid-sentence at the 200-character boundary
 * because the title was the agent's status note rather than anything written
 * to be a title.
 *
 * The detector is not the problem and a better one will not help — `asksPerson`
 * was carefully measured and its own header records the result (fires on 1 of
 * 86 real comments, misses 2 of 3 genuine questions). The problem is that the
 * agent knows perfectly well whether it is asking or reporting and has no way
 * to say so. This is that way.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free on purpose: the MCP tool, the REST route and the
 * browser all check the same rule, and a second copy of a limit is how the
 * card ends up rendering something the API swore it had refused.

 *
 * - The NEWEST declaration decides, and only it. An agent that asks again
 *   has moved on from what it asked before, so an older unanswered payload
 *   buried under a newer answered one is history rather than a live question.
 * - By time, not by array position. Comment order in a Yjs array is a CRDT's
 *   merge order, not a clock — "the last element" answers a question about
 *   array layout, not about who spoke last.
 * - A withdrawn declaration is stepped over, not stopped at. The newest ask
 *   decides only while it stands; one the asker took back has no claim on the
 *   thread, so the search continues underneath it.
 * - A non-open thread has nothing pending: an authored ask is retired by an
 *   ANSWER (`reviewAnswered`), by its ASKER withdrawing it
 *   (`reviewWithdrawn`), or by its thread being resolved, and by nothing
 *   else.
 *
 * `null` means "nothing here to answer" — an ordinary thread, a retired one,

 * with a person's reply sitting directly underneath. The answer path is not
 * unused and a better queue would not help — three surfaces render an Answer
 * composer and route to the answer endpoint, and every OTHER door a reply can
 * come through (a task panel's discussion composer, a widget, an agent
 * relaying words, an older bundle) posts a plain comment. On those doors a
 * person answers in their own words and the row stays queued behind them.
 *
 * So the reply is read as the answer — but only where reading it that way
 * cannot INVENT one:
 *
 * - **Nothing offered → the words are the answer.** An open question has no
 *   vocabulary of its own; prose is the only shape its answer can take, and a
 *   person who typed prose under it has answered it.
 * - **Options offered → only the label answers.** A decision's options ARE
 *   the answer's vocabulary, and prose under one is as often a question back
 *   ("is there a reason to trigger it?") as a pick. Guessing which option
 *   prose meant is the regression this codebase already shipped once, when
 *   "a person spoke" was itself the record of an answer and one line of small
 *   talk retired a decision and took its card with it. Typing the label is
 *   still a pick, because that is how a person picks with no buttons in front
 *   of them — a phone keyboard, a widget, an agent passing the words along.
 *
 * Trimmed and case-folded, and nothing looser. Anything fuzzier is the
 * inference the second rule exists to refuse. Measured against the 12: this
 * captures the 4 with no options, and leaves the 8 prose answers on decisions
 * where they are — visible, unanswered, and a decision for the owner rather
 * than a guess by the server.
 *
 * `null` means "this reply answered nothing" and the caller posts an ordinary
 * comment. `{}` — an answer that picked no option — is not a lesser answer;
