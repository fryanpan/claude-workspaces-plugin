/**
 * A board row's SCHEDULE: the rule that says when work should start, and the
 * arithmetic that turns that rule into the next instant it is owed.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and clock-free — the caller passes `now`, and every
 * function is a total function of its arguments. That is what lets the
 * scheduler be driven by an injected clock in tests instead of by a timer, the
 * same seam `StallNudger` uses (docs/architecture/stall-detection.md).
 *
 * It lives in `core` rather than beside the runner because three other
 * surfaces are going to need the same shapes: the phrase editor that writes a
 * rule as chips, the board section that renders the next occurrence, and the
 * MCP verbs that will eventually set one. A second spelling of "every weekday
 * at 9" in the browser would be a second answer to when the row is owed.
 *
 * ── The two recurrence modes ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The plan (docs/architecture/scheduled-tasks.md) settled on the split Things
 * and Todoist both arrived at:
 *
 *  - **fixed cadence** — the next occurrence comes from the SCHEDULE, whether
 *    or not the last one was finished (`every`, `calendar`);
 *  - **after completion** — the next occurrence comes from when the last
 *    instance FINISHED (`after-completion`), so a rule whose work is still
 *    open is owed nothing at all.
 *
 * `once` is neither: a one-off fires at its instant and is then spent.
