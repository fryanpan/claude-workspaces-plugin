/**
 * Where a review item stands is derived from the item's own facts — and the
 * facts have to decide a TIE.
 *
 * `reviewItemState` first compared clocks alone: a question newer than the
 * last revision meant "waiting". A revision and the next question landing in
 * the same millisecond — which the route-level suite produced four runs in
 * five — tied, and a tie read as "revised": the item went back on the
 * reader's queue while their new question sat unanswered. The item carries a
 * better fact: every revision is stamped with the thread of the question it
 * was made against, so a revision that does not name the latest question's
 * thread was made before it, whatever the clocks say.
 *
 * Fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
