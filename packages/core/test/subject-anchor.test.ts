/**
 * A thread about the SUBJECT rather than about a span inside it.
 *
 * Every anchor kind so far points INTO a document: a text range, a DOM
 * element, or the memory of one that has gone (orphan). There was no way to
 * say "this comment is about the thing itself" — which is the only kind of
 * comment a board task can carry, because a task's discussion is about the
 * task, and a freshly created task's description is empty, so there is
 * nothing in it to point at. `create_thread` requires a `find` string and
 * `POST /api/docs/<id>/threads` requires an anchor, so neither a person nor
 * an agent could open that discussion at all.
 *
 * The invariant that earns this its own kind: a subject anchor can never
 * break, so it must never be orphaned. Orphaning is how a thread gets
 * filtered out of the surfaces that show anchored comments, and a task
 * discussion that vanishes because someone rewrote the description would be
 * the store-has-it/surface-can't-show-it failure again.
