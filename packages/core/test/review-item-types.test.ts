/**
 * The review-item CONTRACT, exercised through the three modules written in
 * terms of it.
 *
 * `review-item-types.ts` declares shapes and nothing else, so there is no
 * function here to call directly. What it can be held to is the two claims
 * the split was made for, and both are runtime facts:
 *
 *  - it EMITS NOTHING, which is what lets the quality gate and the defensive
 *    readers reach the contract without importing the verbs that act on it.
 *    They used to import `review-item.ts` for its types, so the module that
 *    imports them imported them back — a cycle that only stayed harmless
 *    because the import happened to be type-only.
 *  - the names `review-item.ts` re-exports are the SAME shapes, so nothing
 *    downstream had to move. Every value below is annotated with a type
 *    imported from the new file and then handed to a function imported from
 *    the old one; if the re-export ever named something else, this file would
 *    not compile.
 *
 * Fixtures are synthetic. The repo is public.
