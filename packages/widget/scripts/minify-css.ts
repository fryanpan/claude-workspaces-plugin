/**
 * Minify the widget's stylesheet on the way into the bundle.
 *
 * `styles.ts` holds the CSS in a template literal, and a JS minifier does not
 * look inside string contents — so every comment, newline and indent in that
 * literal used to ship inside the bundle. Minifying here keeps the source
 * readable and commented while the browser gets only what it needs. It is
 * worth about 1.7 KB raw / 340 bytes gzipped against a hard budget.
 *
 * `${...}` interpolations are lifted out before the rewrite and put back
 * afterwards, so nothing collapses whitespace or punctuation inside an
 * expression — `${STATUS_COLORS.open}` has to come through untouched.
 *
 * The transform is deliberately small rather than a full CSS parser. It is
 * safe for this stylesheet because it contains no `url(data:...)`, no quoted
 * `content:` string with whitespace touching one of `{}:;,>` (the two it has,
 * `"on "` and `"✓ "`, end in a space before the quote, which survives), and no
 * descendant combinator followed by a pseudo-class (`.a :first-child`), which
 * is the one selector shape where dropping the space around `:` would change
 * meaning. `css-minify.test.ts` pins those.
