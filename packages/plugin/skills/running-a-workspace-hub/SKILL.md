# Running a live-feedback workspace hub

A hub workspace is a **north-star goal + an ordered task board + linked docs**,
rendered at `/workspaces/<workspaceId>`. Everything on it is reachable from
MCP tools: you can create the board, order its goals, file work as tasks a
person can read, ask a human a decision and record their verbatim answer, and
hand the whole thing to the next agent with no chat handoff.

**Do it all with the tools.** Two agents have reconstructed this API by reading
the server source and got the shapes wrong; a `curl` at the REST layer looks
identical to a proper board and proves nothing about whether the product works.
If a tool you need does not exist, that is a blocker to report and a task to
file.

This skill is the tool contract. The **discipline** of working an existing
board — priority order, fanning out, when to stop — lives in
`live-feedback:working-a-workspace-board`. Read both.

## First: two different things are called "workspace"

| | Hub workspace (this skill) | Grouping workspace |
|---|---|---|
| Made by | `create_workspace` | `bind_folder` / `create_diff_review` |
| Id called | `workspaceId`, `hubWorkspaceId` | `workspaceId`, `reviewId` |
| Is | a goal + task board + doc links | a set of review docs over files |
| URL | `/workspaces/<id>` | the review's `entryUrl` |

`delete_workspace`, `refresh_workspace`, `set_workspace_groups` and
`share_workspace` take the **grouping** id — never a hub id. Link a grouping
workspace onto a board with `attach_doc(workspaceId, docId)`; `docId` there
accepts a doc id *or* a review/bind id, and the whole review attaches as one
unit.

## Stand up the board

```
create_workspace(
  name: "search-revamp",              // required, short handle
  goal: "Cut p95 search latency below 200ms without losing recall.",
)
→ { workspaceId, name, goal, leadAgentId }
```

- `goal` is the **north-star statement every triage decision is judged
  against**. Markdown, a sentence or two. Keep it current with
  `set_workspace_goal`.
- **You become the board's lead agent** unless you pass `leadAgentId`. The lead
  is the addressee for goal-edit re-triage (see the last section). Hand the
  seat over later with `set_workspace_lead(workspaceId, leadAgentId)`.
- The call auto-subscribes this session to the workspace event channel
  (`task.*`, `decision.answered`, `triage.requested`, `workspace.goal_updated`,
  …), which arrives on the same channel as thread events. Pass
  `subscribe: false` to skip.

Then give it sections:

```
set_goal_list(workspaceId, goals: [
  { id: "latency", title: "Cut p95 latency",
    subgoals: [{ id: "index", title: "Index shape" }] },
  { id: "recall",  title: "Hold recall at parity", dueAt: 1767225600000 },
])
```

- **Order IS priority.** The first goal is the highest band. To CHANGE that
  order, use `reorder_goals` (below) rather than this call — it fires the same
  `workspace.goals_changed`, never a re-triage, and it cannot lose a goal.
- One subgoal level, maximum. `dueAt` is epoch ms and optional at every
  level — never invent one.
- `"chores"` is **reserved**: it always renders last and must not appear in the
  list you pass.
- **Destructive edge, now gated:** this is a full REPLACE, so any id you leave
  out is removed — including a goal another writer added since you last read.
  If a removed id still holds tasks the call is **refused** with
  `would-strand-tasks`, naming each band and how many open and done tasks it
  holds, and nothing is written. Removing a band that holds work is therefore
  a second, deliberate call that lists its id in `drop`; removing an empty one
  needs no ceremony. On success the result reports `movedToChores` (open tasks
  swept to the bottom of Chores — re-place each with `set_task_goal` rather
  than leaving them piled) and `strandedDone` (done tasks still pointing at
  the removed id, which is what leaves a bare row in `get_workspace`).

## Rename a goal with `rename_goal`, not `set_goal_list`

```
rename_goal(workspaceId, goal: "latency", title: "Cut p95 latency to 200ms")
rename_goal(workspaceId, goal: "index",   title: "Index shape", dueAt: null)
```

- **The id never changes, so nothing moves.** A task's band IS its goal id.
- This is the reason the verb exists: `set_goal_list` is keyed by id, so
  "renaming" a band there by giving it a new id is a removal plus an addition
  — its open tasks land in Chores and its done tasks orphan onto an id that no
  longer exists, and the new title appears exactly as if it had worked. The
  damage is proportional to how much the band held, and it surfaces days later
  as "why is my top band empty".
- `dueAt` is optional: a number sets it, `null` clears it, omitting it leaves
  it alone. `chores` is refused — its label is fixed.

## Change priority with `reorder_goals`, not `set_goal_list`

```
reorder_goals(workspaceId, order: ["recall", "latency"])
reorder_goals(workspaceId, order: ["shape", "index"], parent: "latency")
```

- **Permutation only.** `order` must be exactly the goal ids already at one
  scope — the top-level list, or the subgoals of `parent`. Ids, no titles.
- An order that omits, repeats or invents an id is **refused**, naming the
  offending ids. That refusal is the feature: a list that changed under you
  makes you re-read rather than silently dropping somebody's goal.
- Nothing is created, renamed, removed or reparented, and **no task moves** —
  the Chores hazard above cannot happen here.
- Get the ids from `get_workspace`, whose rows carry `depth` and, on
  subgoals, `parent`.

## Read the board before you decide anything

```
get_workspace(workspaceId)
→ { workspaceId, name, goal, goalUpdatedAt, leadAgentId, pendingRetriage?, goals }
```

`goals` is the **ordered** list with per-goal todo / in-progress / done counts,
parent goals followed by their subgoals, Chores last. `list_tasks` returns goal
**ids** only — without `get_workspace` the ordering is invisible and you will
work the wrong band. It is deliberately cheap (goals and counts, no tasks);
pair it with `next_tasks`, which carries the tasks and their full descriptions.

## File work

`create_tasks` is the create verb, and it always takes a LIST — one task is a
one-row list, so there is never a choice to make about which tool to reach for.

```
create_tasks(workspaceId, tasks: [
  {
    title: "Cache the tokenizer between queries",
    body: "Agent can reuse a warm tokenizer so that p95 drops without a reindex.\n\n"
        + "Done when: a repeated query allocates no new tokenizer, and the "
        + "latency benchmark shows the p95 delta.",
    goal: "latency",          // OMIT to route through triage
    key: "warm-cache",        // so a later ROW can depend on this one
    links: [{ kind: "url", url: "https://example.test/pr/41" }],
  },
  {
    title: "Benchmark the p95 after the cache lands",
    goal: "latency",
    after: ["#warm-cache"],   // a row of this batch, by key; or [0] by index
    afterEnforce: ["#warm-cache"],
  },
])
→ { created: [{ title, taskId, goal, order, status, assignee, placed, … }],
    failures: [{ index, title, error, message }],
    placement?: { unplaced, triageDelivered, goals } }
```

Only `workspaceId` and a `title` per row are required. What matters:

- **`body` — write one on every task**, even though the schema does not demand
  it. A bare title is not pickup-able by an agent that was not in the
  conversation. Shape it as a compact user story: `<persona> can <do x> so that
  <goal y>`, **one** persona (Agent / Bryan / Collaborator), plus falsifiable
  "done when" criteria for anything handed to someone else or parked beyond
  today. Work you will finish within the hour needs the story line and nothing
  more. It renders on the task and comes back whole from `next_tasks` — do not
  create a separate doc to hold it.
- **`goal` — omit it when you have not judged placement yet.** The task lands
  UNPLACED at the bottom of Chores and a triage request goes to the live
  workspace agent (possibly you). An explicit goal — *even `"chores"`* — is a
  placement and skips triage. The create says which happened: `placed` is
  whether YOU named a goal (not whether the goal is `chores`), `triagePending`
  is whether the request actually reached a live attachment, and `goals` — the
  ordered bands — comes back when nothing placed it, so `set_task_goal` is the
  next call rather than a `get_workspace` first.
- **`key` + `after` — a row can depend on another row of the SAME batch**, by
  key (`"#warm-cache"`) or by index (`0`, or `"#0"`). Backwards only: rows are
  created in order, so a forward reference is refused, and so is a reference to
  a row that failed — a task carrying a dependency that never blocks it is
  worse than a refusal. An entry with no `#` is still a task id you hold.
- **`quote` — the human's VERBATIM words**, for chat-born asks. Kept on the
  task forever. Do not paraphrase it.
- `after` / `afterEnforce`: `afterEnforce` is a **subset** of `after`. An id in
  `afterEnforce` alone is refused rather than silently widening `after`.
- `links` kinds: `{kind:'doc',docId}` · `{kind:'thread',docId,threadId}` ·
  `{kind:'task',taskId}` · `{kind:'diff',workspaceId}` ·
  `{kind:'url',url}`. Use `url` for anything off this server — a pull request,
  a dashboard, a decision page; http(s) only. Refs are not existence-checked; a
  malformed one is dropped into `ignoredLinks` and the task is still created.
- `order` is a fractional position within the goal.

**Thread-born asks use `promote_to_task(docId, threadId, workspaceId)`** instead
— it captures the origin ref, takes the latest **human** comment as the quote
(agent replies never become the quote), and drafts a title and body from it.
Same goal semantics: omit `goal` to route through triage.

### Every task body is a live review doc

A task's description is backed by a real markdown room with
`docId = "task:<taskId>"` (`packages/server/src/task-projection.ts`). So the
normal doc tools work on it: `watch_doc("task:t-abc123")` to receive comment
events, `create_thread` / `post_reply` to have the conversation next to the
work, `get_doc` to read it. Edits snapshot back into the task body. This is how
"ask for feedback on the task, not in chat" is actually done from an agent —
there is no `comment_on_task` tool.

**Omit `find` to comment on the task itself.** A description you want to
question is often empty, or the thing you want to ask about is the task rather
than a phrase inside it, so `create_thread` takes no anchor text in that case:

```
create_thread(
  docId: "task:t-abc123",
  text: "This assumes the index ships first — is that still true after the retriage?",
)
```

The thread appears in the task's Discussion on the board, and it never
orphans, however the description is later rewritten. Pass `find` when you do
want the comment pinned to a specific line; an EMPTY `find` is an error rather
than a shortcut to this, so a variable that came out blank can't quietly turn
into a comment on the whole task.

## Decisions

A decision is a task with `needs: 'decision'` and a human assignee.

```
create_tasks(workspaceId, tasks: [
  {
    title: "Pick the tokenizer cache eviction policy",
    assignee: "human",
    needs: "decision",
    goal: "latency",
    body: "Do we evict the tokenizer cache by LRU or keep one per index forever?\n\n"
        + "Memory is the constraint: one-per-index costs ~40MB steady state and "
        + "never stalls; LRU holds ~8MB but can stall a cold query by 300ms.\n\n"
        + "- LRU: cheap memory, occasional cold-start stall\n"
        + "- One per index: predictable latency, 5x the memory\n\n"
        + "The latency work is blocked until this is answered.",
    options: [
      { label: "LRU", detail: "8MB steady, up to 300ms on a cold query" },
      { label: "One per index", detail: "40MB steady, no stall" },
    ],
  },
])
```

**The body is REQUIRED and has a shape**: the question in one line, what is at
stake in two or three, the options with what each one costs, then what is
blocked until it is answered. Only the first part is enforced — a body with no
question mark anywhere is **refused**, because the failure this catches is
filing a progress report as a decision (field populated, every check passes,
and the person asked to decide has nothing to decide from). The other three
come back as advisory `shapeGaps` on a successful create.

`options` are candidate answers: `[{label, detail?}]`. `label` is the text
recorded verbatim if it is picked; `detail` is what picking it costs. Supply
them whenever you have candidates — two or more, or don't bother. They are a
shortcut, never a closed set; writing a different answer stays available.

**Record the answer verbatim** when they tell you in chat or voice (in the UI
they answer directly):

```
answer_decision(taskId, text: "<their exact words>", optionId?: "<option they picked>")
→ { taskId, recorded: true, links: [...] }
```

Never paraphrase. When they picked an option, pass the option's **label** as
`text` and its id as `optionId` — the answer is still the text. The returned
`links` are a **ready-made propagation checklist**: act on each, or create a
task for it, and prioritize them right away. `answer_decision` does **not**
transition the task — close it with `task_transition` once the propagation is
handled.

**Say that a decision is blocking work**, or it reads as parked however loudly
its body says otherwise:

```
set_task_dependencies(taskId: "<the BLOCKED task>", after: ["<the decision>"],
                      afterEnforce: ["<the decision>"])
```

That edge is the only record of "this decision is holding work up now" — the
board derives a decision's urgency from what points at it, and there is
deliberately no urgency field. It replaces the whole edge set, so pass the full
list; an empty `after` clears the edges.

## Triage: placement is the write half

```
set_task_goal(taskId, goal: "latency", position: 2.5, riskTier: "yellow", batchId?)
```

- **Pick the spot, not just the bucket.** `position` is fractional — there is
  always room between two tasks; omitted means bottom of the goal.
- It stamps `triagedAgainst` with the goal text you judged against and clears
  the triage-pending marker. Every move is recorded and fires `task.regrouped`,
  so regroup freely — the safety is the record, not asking first. When a move
  would cross a human's earlier placement, leave a comment on the task doc
  referencing it.
- **`riskTier` is how dangerous EXECUTING the task is, never how important it
  is.** `green` reversible/contained · `yellow` outward-facing or hard to
  reverse · `red` irreversible/one-way. It is keyed to the action's damage.

## The work loop

**Attach, and read the briefing.**

```
attach_agent(workspaceId)
→ { workspaceId, agentId, gating, lead, untriaged, queuedVoice, pendingRetriage? }
```

Defaults: `agentId` = this agent's MCP identity, `runtime` =
`claude-code-local`. This is the fresh-context briefing:

- `gating` — a one-line summary of open decisions gating tasks.
- `untriaged` — task ids to sweep with `set_task_goal`.
- `queuedVoice` — voice change-requests that arrived while no agent was live.
  Act on each transcript **verbatim**.
- `lead` — whether you hold the lead seat. An **empty** seat is claimed by the
  first agent to attach; an occupied one is a standing decision and a second
  agent attaching is not a reassignment.
- `pendingRetriage` — only if you lead. See below.

**All of these are drained by this call.** Nothing offers them again.

**Stay live.** `heartbeat(workspaceId)` every few minutes. After ~5 minutes of
silence the hub shows you as **away and triage requests queue** rather than
reaching you. A fresh heartbeat with a stale `toolCallAt` renders as "process
up, agent unresponsive" — which is why the call stamps the work clock too
unless you pass an explicit earlier `toolCallAt`. `list_attachments(workspaceId)`
shows who is where and whether anyone is wedged.

**Take work from the queue.**

```
next_tasks(workspaceId, assignee: "<your name>")
→ rows in priority order (goal band, then task order)
```

Each row carries its **full description**, plus `blockedBy` (open dependencies;
only `enforce` ones hold it back) and `ready`. Hard-blocked rows are omitted
unless `includeBlocked: true`. Call it at the top of a session **and again
whenever a line of work finishes** — priorities move while you work.

**The lead decides the shape of the fan-out.** That queue reaches everyone
identically; what this seat adds is deciding how many lines run at once and in
what order their merges land. The default is every ready row that doesn't
collide, and the criteria — what counts as a collision, and what forces a
sequence of the merge rather than of the work — are in
`live-feedback:working-a-workspace-board`. Don't re-derive them here. Two
things only the lead can do about it:

- **Make the board judgeable.** A batch is planned by reading descriptions
  against each other, so thin bodies are what forces a session to run serial.
  Same for a real ordering constraint left in somebody's head instead of in
  `after` / `afterEnforce` — the queue can only respect an edge that exists.
- **Watch what the board says is running.** Several `in-progress` rows with
  one agent attached is a batch nobody is actually working; one `in-progress`
  row with a long ready queue behind it is the failure this default exists to
  prevent. `list_attachments` and the per-goal counts are the reading.

`assign_task` is also how a line gets an owner — a staffed batch is several
tasks each assigned to the agent running it, so `next_tasks(assignee: …)`
answers for each of them.

**Move status through the one gate.**

```
task_transition(taskId, to: "done", note: "merged in #142",
                evidence: { commit: "<sha>" },
                usage: { inputTokens: 1, outputTokens: 1 })
→ { taskId, status, blockers, unproven }
```

- `todo | in-progress | done`, attributed to you, appended to the task's audit
  trail. **This is the only way status changes.**
- **Attach `evidence` (`{commit}` and/or `{threadRef}`) on forward moves** or
  the move comes back `unproven: true` — allowed, but shaded on the board.
- **Got the evidence wrong, or forgot it? Don't re-send the transition** — it
  refuses with `same-status`. Use `amend_evidence(taskId, evidence, note?)`,
  which APPENDS a correction to the move that already happened: the original
  row keeps what it said (a wrong sha is struck, not deleted), your correction
  sits beside it attributed and timestamped, and the `unproven` shading
  clears. A false sha is the case worth caring about — it reads as proof, so
  nothing looks wrong until someone tries to follow it. Nothing validates that
  a sha resolves; this server has no checkout to look it up in.
- Open `after` dependencies come back in `blockers`; an edge marked **enforce
  refuses the transition (409)** until the blocking task closes. Read the
  message, it names what to unblock.
- **Risk tier gates the actor, not the task.** An *agent* moving a `red` task
  forward is refused outright — a person has to make the move. A `yellow` one
  needs `confirmed: true`, which means the human said yes after you showed them
  the concrete effect. It is not a retry flag; if they haven't answered, don't
  send it. A person is never gated, and **moving back to `todo` is never
  blocked**.
- The tier binds live-feedback-mediated moves only. Actions your own runtime
  performs never touch this server.

**Hand off what isn't yours** with `assign_task(taskId, assignee)` —
`'human'`, `'agent'`, or a named identity — the moment you discover it, rather
than leaving it parked in your column. Status is untouched (re-assigning is not
progress) and the direction of every hand-off is recorded.

## Goal edits and the lead-agent seat

Editing the north-star goal invalidates every placement that was judged against
the old one, so it asks for a re-triage — **addressed to the lead agent**, not
to whoever happens to be connected:

```
set_workspace_goal(workspaceId, goal: "<new north-star statement>")
→ { workspaceId, changed, retriage: { requested, queued, taskIds, batchId } }
```

- `retriage.requested` — it reached the lead live.
- `retriage.queued` — the lead was away (or the board has no lead), and the
  request is **waiting**. It does not expire; the board shows it as pending
  work.

A queued request is delivered as `pendingRetriage` on the lead's next
`attach_agent` — or immediately, if `set_workspace_lead` hands the seat to an
agent who is already live. When you receive one:

```
for each taskId in pendingRetriage.taskIds:
    set_task_goal(taskId, goal: "<placement against the NEW goal>",
                  batchId: pendingRetriage.batchId)
```

**Echo the `batchId` on every move.** It ties each placement to the goal edit
that asked for it, so the activity view reads N moves as one goal edit instead
of N unexplained regroupings.

`get_workspace` also surfaces `pendingRetriage`, but **reading it there does not
drain it** — only `attach_agent` does.

The calls above are the write half. What the lead actually owes on a goal
change — re-reading the goal, sweeping every open task, reordering without
losing a band, and flagging what the edit made obsolete *without* closing
somebody's work — is `live-feedback:handling-a-goal-change`.

## Adopting an existing tracker

A hand-maintained markdown tracker (group headings + status tables) moves onto
a board without re-keying:

```
import_tasks_markdown(workspaceId, path: "/abs/path/to/TRACKER.md")   // DRY RUN
import_tasks_markdown(workspaceId, path: "...", apply: true)          // for real
```

**The default is a dry run** — it returns the mapping (headings → goals, rows →
tasks with normalized status, what was skipped, which columns were ignored) and
creates nothing. Review that mapping with the human first. Apply appends new
goals (existing ones matched by title are reused, never clobbered), creates the
tasks as explicit placements (no triage), walks imported statuses through the
transition gate, and **stamps the source file** with a banner + hub link so the
old tracker cannot quietly stay a second source of truth. A stamped file
refuses re-import (409). Headings map to goals; rows before any heading land in
Chores; a leading H1 is the document title, not a group.
