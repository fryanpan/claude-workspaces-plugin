/**
 * The meeting chrome: one Record Audio button in the top bar that owns
 * everything audio, the live transcript strip fused under it, and the two
 * popovers behind the button — the speaker menu while recording, the start
 * chooser while not.
 *
 * IT IS THE ONLY SURFACE A MEETING HAS. The transcript is never written into
 * the document — the notes agent does that later, from the durable transcript
 * the server keeps — so every state a meeting can be left in has to arrive as
 * words here: a mic that was refused, an origin the browser will not give a
 * mic on at all, a server with no transcription key. A strip that renders
 * nothing in those cases is a Start button that does nothing when pressed,
 * which is the failure this file exists to avoid.
 *
 * IT RESERVES HEIGHT. The strip is the shell's second grid row, directly
 * under the top bar it grows out of, so the editor below is shorter by
 * exactly its height rather than running underneath it. Hidden, the row is
 * zero. Layout rules live in doc.css under MEETING RECORD CHROME and are
 * asserted in `meeting-strip-css.test.ts`, because no DOM test resolves
 * layout.
 *
 * ONE TAP WHEN ALONE. A Record press on a doc with nobody else on it starts
 * a solo recording at once — no chooser, the server's default engine — because
 * every question the chooser asks (who will the microphone hear, should a bot
 * go instead) has no answer when there is nobody else there, and a form that
 * recurs unchanged is friction rather than a decision (Urgent-fixes ticket,
 * 2026-09-02: "start recording in one tap when he is alone"). Whether anyone
 * else is here is the doc's presence, asked at press time through
 * `opts.alone` (`meeting-solo.ts`); with a collaborator on the doc the press
 * opens the chooser as before. The chooser itself stays one tap away either
 * way, behind the small options button beside Record — a conversation in a
 * room nobody else has the doc open in still has to be asked for somewhere.
 *
 * EVERY BILLED CHOICE HAPPENS AT START TIME. The chooser collects the source
 * (microphone, or a bot sent to a Zoom / Google Meet call) and whether the
 * room has one voice or several — a streaming session's configuration IS its
 * connect URL, so switching either mid-meeting would mean a second session
 * and a second bill for the same conversation. Which engine listens is NOT a
 * question it asks: the server's default runs unless the address names one
 * (`?engine=soniox`, a preference read on every visit — see huddle-entry.ts),
 * and the picker that used to sit above Speakers came out with the ticket
 * above. The bot path transcribes the vendor's raw audio through the same
 * engines, so the preference applies there too. The one exception to
 * start-time is the Advanced Options panel (meeting-advanced.ts), which stays
 * reachable from the menu while recording: AssemblyAI's protocol can change
 * its turn-detection knobs on the open socket, and everything it cannot
 * change waits for the next recording and says so under the control.
 *
 * IT NO LONGER ANNOUNCES ITSELF TO THE ROOM. A `conversation` capture used to
 * speak a fixed sentence into its own microphone, offer a second button that
 * declined it, and record which path was taken. All of it came out on
 * 2026-09-01 (Bryan: "This is too much fiddling. I'll manually handle consent
 * for now.") — it put a decision in front of somebody on every recording, in a
 * room that was already talking, for a claim the client could not stand
 * behind. What replaced it is one line at the head of the transcript,
 * `RECORDING_CONSENT_NOTE`, addressed to the person recording. Speakers is now
 * a plain question about who the microphone will hear, and nothing else.
 *
 * CORRECTIONS LAND ON THE WORD ALREADY ON SCREEN. A `transcript` frame carries
 * the WHOLE turn as currently understood, so a later frame for the same turn
 * is the engine revising itself. `diffTurnWords` finds which words actually
 * moved and only those are rewritten and flashed — redrawing the line instead
 * would make every partial look like a correction.
