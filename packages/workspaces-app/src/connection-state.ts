 * Restarting prod is standing policy, so the reconnect window is a normal
 * part of shipping rather than a crash symptom — and during it every surface
 * has to read as "back in a moment", not as the app falling over.
 *
 * The transport is already fine: ws-client emits connecting|closed|open and
 * backs off 500ms→10s on its own. What was missing is a reading of it. Two
 * rules make that reading deliberate:
 *
 *  1. A drop is only worth mentioning once it has LASTED. Below the grace
 *     window the socket usually repairs itself, and a banner that paints and
 *     unpaints inside a second is the flicker this exists to remove.
 *  2. The view changes, not the status. ws-client cycles connecting→closed
 *     on every retry attempt; all of those are one state to a reader, so
 *     onView fires on transitions between 'online' and 'reconnecting' and
 *     never once per attempt.
 *
 * Recovery needs no reload: 'open' clears the timer and, if a banner is up,
 * takes it down.

 *  1. **The server replays nothing.** There is no `Last-Event-ID` handling

 *  2. **The client only ever refetched from the stream.** Every call to the
 *     queue's loader after boot hung off an SSE listener — no error handler,
 *     no reopen handler, no visibility handler, no poll.
 *
 * `EventSource` reconnects on its own, which is exactly what makes this so
 * quiet: the page comes back looking perfectly healthy while silently missing
 * everything created during the gap. A server restart is that gap on every
 * deploy, and so is a slept laptop or a backgrounded phone.
 *
 * The first `open` deliberately does not refetch — the page has just loaded
 * the same data — so this costs one extra round of REST calls per genuine
