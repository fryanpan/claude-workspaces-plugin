/**
 * The task detail panel — the ticket a reader opens to answer something — as a
 * Preact island.
 *
 * `renderTaskDetail` rebuilt the whole panel with `replaceChildren()` on every
 * `thread.*` and `task.transitioned` event, and the board emits those
 * constantly. Everything the panel was HOLDING died with each rebuild, and
 * every rescue had to be hand-built against the same one-line window before
 * the swap:
 *
 *   - `keepFields` / `restoreFields` snapshotted the drafts out of the doomed
 *     DOM and wrote them back into the fresh one, caret and all;
 *   - `priorTab` read which tab was showing off `panel.dataset.tab`;
 *   - `priorReviewIndex` / `priorReviewItemId` read the queue's position off
 *     `.hub-decide`'s dataset;
 *   - `priorQuoteOpen` read whether the reader had unfolded the preserved
 *     capture off the `<details>` a line before it was destroyed.
 *
 * Every one of those was a workaround for the node being thrown away, and all
 * four are gone. `TaskDetailPanel` is keyed on `task.id`, so a repaint of the
 * SAME task reuses the instance and its DOM — the tab and the queue position
 * are `useState`, the `<details>`'s `open` is the node's own (Preact is never
 * told about it, so it never writes it back), and an uncontrolled `<textarea>`
 * that keeps its node keeps its words, its focus and its caret for free.
 * Moving to another task changes the key, which unmounts the panel — so the
 * next ticket opens on Comments, with the capture folded and an empty box,
 * which is the other half of the guarantee.
 *
 * The bridge is one-directional, as in the board, Home-review, presence and
 * walkthrough islands: `renderDetail` in hub-app still owns the fetches, the
 * projection and the audit rows, and writes them into `taskDetailData`; the
 * island only reads.
 *
 * Two things ride the signal rather than being bound at mount, both for the
 * walkthrough's reason — they answer about THIS paint:
 *
 *   - the HANDLERS, which close over the task, the review rows, the blocked
 *     row and the clock the loader resolved for this paint;
 *   - the DISCUSSION, which is refetched per task.
 *
 * And two kinds of node are deliberately not Preact's children, because they
 * re-parent or replace their own DOM and Preact would drag them back on the
 * next diff:
 *
 *   - every composer `<form>` — `attachMarkdownComposer` REPLACES the textarea
 *     with a wrapper and moves it (design point 4). The form element is
 *     Preact's and its children are not: a vnode with no children is diffed
 *     against nothing, so nothing inside is touched.
 *   - the description slot and the title `<h2>` — the live Tiptap editor mounts
 *     INTO the slot, and `wireInPlaceTitle` swaps the heading's text for an
 *     `<input>` mid-rename. Same trick, same reason: an element with no vnode
 *     children is an element Preact never reaches into.

 *
 * The backdrop tap is wired here rather than per paint: it is a fact about the
