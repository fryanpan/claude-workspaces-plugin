/**
 * Which comment threads have outgrown the balloon column.
 *
 * The margin is 300px wide. That is the right size for the comment it was
 * designed around — a sentence or two beside the line it points at — and the
 * wrong size for the two things that keep landing in it instead: a long
 * exchange, and a declared DECISION, whose card carries a kind chip, a
 * headline, a markdown body and a stack of option buttons. Both were already
 * being fought with a viewport clamp (`.cw-balloon-comment.expanded` caps its
 * height and scrolls inside itself), which keeps the card on screen but does
 * not give the words anywhere to go: an 80-character measure wrapped into a
 * 300px column is roughly six words a line.
 *
 * So above a threshold the thread stops expanding in place and opens in a wide
 * modal instead. The rules are deliberately two, not one:
 *
 * - **Length.** More than `LONG_THREAD_WORDS` of actual conversation.
 * - **A decision, at any length.** The options are buttons, and a button
 *   holding a 1–3 word label plus up to 50 words of detail cannot be read in a
 *   column narrower than the label. Length would not have caught it — a
 *   decision is often the SHORTEST thread on the doc.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free on purpose: which threads promote is a rule, and the
 * viewport question ("is the modal the right treatment here at all") belongs to
 * the caller, which is the only thing that knows whether the mobile sheet is
 * already the surface.
