 * The document editor shell's back arrow.

 * `index.html` ships it as a static `href="/"`, which is the machine-wide
 * landing page — a list of every artifact on the box. That is the wrong
 * destination for a doc reached from a workspace board: the board is where
 * the work is, and returning to the index means finding the board again.
 *
 * The board can only come from the server (`backTo` on `/api/docs/<id>`),
 * because the page itself knows nothing about who linked to it — a doc URL
 * pasted into a message arrives with no referrer at all. So this module is
 * the small half: take the resolved board and point the arrow at it.
 *
 * Kept out of `app.ts` and applied by the router because the arrow is SHELL
 * chrome that outlives each per-doc mount: navigation is in-place, so an
 * arrow left pointing at the previous doc's board is a live wrong link.
