/**
 * Correcting who a note says spoke.
 *
 * A speaker tag is a claim, and diarization gets claims wrong: two people
 * with similar voices trade turns and a whole exchange lands on one label.
 * The tag is the place that error is visible, so it is the place it should
 * be fixable — tap the name, pick the right voice, done.
 *
 * ONE MENTION, ALWAYS (owner's call, 2026-08-31: "reassigning should just
 * affect the one item being reassigned"). Not the turn, not the voice's
 * other notes. The larger gestures — "and every other note from this turn",
 * reaching back into the transcript — are deliberately not built: they are
 * each a different promise about scope, and the narrow one is the promise
 * nobody has to think about before tapping.
 *
 * The edit is an ordinary document edit, dispatched through the editor the
 * person is already in, so it rides the same Yjs sync, the same undo, and
 * the same ~1s flush to the .md as typing a word does. Nothing here talks to
 * the server: a correction is not a different kind of writing.
 *
 * A CORRECTION IS WRITTEN BARE — `speaker:C`, with none of the provenance the
 * composer's own tags carry (`speaker:B?t=10,12`, see core/speaker-tags.ts).
 * That is what takes the mention out of reach of the engine's end-of-session
 * revision: a person has answered, and a later machine guess does not get to
 * revisit it. It is also how tapping the voice a mention ALREADY claims is a
 * real edit rather than a no-op — on a mention the engine marked unsure, that
 * tap is somebody settling it, and the flag goes.
