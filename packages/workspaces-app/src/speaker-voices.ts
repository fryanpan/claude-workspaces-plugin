/**
 * Where the reassign menu's voices come from.

 * WRONG — so a roster built from the doc's own tags would be missing exactly
 * the entry a correction needs. The meetings API knows: it has the names a
 * person gave and the transcript that says who said what.
 *
 * The most recent meeting only. A doc can carry several, and a tag does not
 * record which one it came from; asking every meeting for its transcript
 * would be several requests to answer one tap, and offering a voice from a
 * meeting three weeks ago is not the correction anybody is reaching for.
