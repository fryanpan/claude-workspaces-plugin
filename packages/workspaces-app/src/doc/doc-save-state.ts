/**
 * The `#save-state` chip: "All changes saved", "Unsaved changes",
 * "Reconnecting…".
 *
 * TWO facts drive it and they are deliberately not one. `wsOnline` is the raw
 * socket, updated the instant it changes, and it decides whether an edit may
 * be called saved. `reconnecting` is the graced VIEW, and it decides what the
 * chip says — so a blip never repaints, while nothing is ever reported as
 * saved to a server that isn't there. Keeping both in one module is what
 * stops a second writer appearing and reporting one from the other.
 *
 * The teardown is load-bearing: `#save-state` is shared chrome, so a pending
 * debounce from THIS mount would otherwise rewrite it over the next document
 * — one that may have no save state at all.
