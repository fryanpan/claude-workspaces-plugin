 * The five writes a comment card can make, and what the reader is told when
 * one fails.
 *
 * Reply, undo-answer, resolve, reopen, re-anchor: every one is a POST to this
 * document's thread routes and a toast, and none of them touches the DOM, the
 * ydoc or the panel. The repaint comes from the websocket — the server writes
 * the thread, the CRDT syncs it, the observer redraws — so there is no client
 * state to keep here and nothing to roll back on failure.
 *
 * One module because the failure contract is the part that is easy to get
 * wrong and has to be uniform: a refused ANSWER toasts and returns `false`,
 * which is what makes the panel put the typed words back in the box instead
 * of clearing them over an error; a refused undo of an answer somebody else
 * already took back toasts nothing, because the live repaint is already
 * showing the outcome and a "try again" over an already-done undo reads as a
 * broken button.
