/**
 * The selection affordances over a markdown document: the round comment pill
 * and the cached selection both it and the composer anchor to.
 *
 * One module because they are one state machine, not two widgets. A gesture
 * suppresses the pill; a settled selection brings it back; a caret shows a
 * lighter pill over the sentence it would select; a blur takes both away —
 * and every one of those transitions writes the SAME cached selection, which
 * is the thing iOS destroys between the pill appearing and the tap landing.
 * Split across files, that cache would need a second writer, which is exactly
 * the bug the cache exists to prevent.
 *
 * On a huddle doc a range selection grows the pointer pill instead (see
 * doc-pointer-pill.ts); the round pill survives there only in caret mode,
 * where pressing it opens the composer exactly as it does everywhere else.
