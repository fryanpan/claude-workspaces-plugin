 * ```
 *
 * Each summary line is paired with what it BECOMES, and both faces are
 * built here, together, always — the expand animation cross-fades between
 * two faces that already exist in the same box, so neither may be built
 * lazily and neither may be omitted. Only the head sits outside both slots,
 * so expanding never rebuilds or moves it.
 *
 * WHAT A CARD DOES NOT SAY (Bryan, 2026-09-04, on mock round 4). No kind
 * chip: a row of option buttons IS a decision and a field with a send button
 * IS a question, so a "DECIDE" badge beside them restates what the reader can
 * already press. No reply count, no "No replies yet", no captions — a card
 * spending a row to report an absence is a row that says nothing. **The
 * control is the marking.** What is left of the old chips are the two states
 * that have no affordance to read at all: resolved, and orphaned.
