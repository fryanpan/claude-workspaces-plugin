/**
 * The last phase of a markdown document's boot: what this browser is allowed
 * to do with the surface.
 *
 * Three things in one place because between them they settle one question.
 * The format bar's own collapse toggle and its hotkey; the view/edit and
 * Suggesting interlock (doc-modes.ts); and the read-only lock that overrides
 * both when the server will not accept writes. The lock has to run AFTER the
 * toggles exist, because it drives them through the handle they hand back —
 * putting the order here is what keeps it from being an accident of two call
 * sites.
 *
 * Synchronous, and last in the mount, because it speaks for the whole
 * surface: `canWrite` arrived on the MountContext, so nothing here waits on a
 * network answer and nothing is editable in the meantime.
