/**
 * Everything a live meeting needs mounted over a markdown document: the
 * transcript strip along the bottom of the editor pane, the provisional live
 * zone at the end of the prose, the Recall bot client behind the strip's
 * chrome, and the lead banner a huddle doc carries.
 *
 * One function rather than four because they are only ever mounted together
 * and under one condition — an ordinary markdown doc with a strip element,
 * never a diff member's companion view. The mount reads the huddle flag off
 * the address and takes it back out, so it has to run exactly once.
 *
 * It hands back the two things the rest of the mount closes over: the live
 * zone the wash extension asks about, and the lead-presence watch the floats
 * quote in their receipts. Both are absent on a doc that holds no meeting.
