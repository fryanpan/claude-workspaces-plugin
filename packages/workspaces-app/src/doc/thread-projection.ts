/**
 * The projection from this document's ydoc to the threads every review
 * surface renders.
 *
 * One reader, four consumers: the drawer panel, the margin balloons, the
 * mobile inline cards and the wide modal all render whatever `collect()`
 * returns. This surface does NOT go through core's `readThread` — it
 * hand-builds each `Thread` so a text-range anchor that no longer resolves
 * can display as orphaned without touching what is persisted — which is
 * exactly why the build lives in one place: a field listed here and nowhere
 * else is a field the whole app renders, and a field forgotten here is one
 * the server can write, sync, and have nobody ever show (see the `summary`
 * story in docs/process/learnings.md).
 *
 * It owns three pieces of state and nothing else reads or writes them: which
 * thread is active (the decoration highlight follows it), the "a summary is
 * being generated" expiry timer, and the seen tracker's in-place dot removal.
 * Everything else — the panel, the count badge, the sheet, the modal — is the
 * caller's, and reaches this module only as the `onPendingExpiry` redraw
 * request. Nothing here reaches back into `mountReviewChrome`.
