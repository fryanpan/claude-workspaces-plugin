/**
 * The browser half of the live-meeting latency measurement: the marks only
 * this side can take, the clock exchange that makes the server's marks
 * comparable, and the small readout that shows the answer while it is being
 * measured.
 *
 * IT EXISTS ONLY WHEN ASKED. `mountMeetingStrip` builds one when the address
 * carries `?timing=1`; on every other page load nothing here is constructed,
 * no clock is read per audio frame, and the strip is the strip. The point of
 * the flag is that the measurement can run on PROD, against a real
 * conversation, without prod carrying it the rest of the time.
 *
 * THE THREE MARKS THAT ARE OURS. The server can see everything from its own
 * receive to its own send; the two ends of the story are here — when the
 * audio frame went out, and when the words it produced were actually on the
 * screen. The paint mark is a `requestAnimationFrame` callback followed by a
 * task: rAF runs BEFORE style, layout and paint of that frame, so marking
 * inside it would time the work up to the frame and call it "painted". The
 * task that runs after it is the first moment the frame is committed.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER TOUCHES. No transcript text, no doc id, no title, no URL
 * reaches a sample, a CSV column, or the readout. The measured population is
 * "the last word of a transcript frame", named by its audio offset. Nothing
 * is sent anywhere: the samples live in this tab until someone downloads
 * them.
