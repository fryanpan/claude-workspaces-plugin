 * The meeting doc's "nobody is listening" line.

 * Every ask a meeting doc makes — the Make Plan and Review floats, a task or
 * research ask said aloud — is addressed to the board's lead agent, and all
 * of them file fine into an empty seat. The person then waits on an answer
 * that is not coming, and finds out later. So while it is true, the doc
 * says it, plainly and persistently: no lead agent is listening, asks will
 * queue until one attaches. Recording is never held up by it, and nothing
 * here is dismissable — the state is the thing to fix.
 *
 * "Listening" is the server's word (`GET /api/docs/:id/lead-presence`): the
 * seat is held and its holder can be handed something now, not merely
 * connected. The GET registers this page; changes then arrive on the doc's
 * event stream as `lead.presence`, and the banner shows or goes with them.
 * Unknown (the GET failed) shows nothing: a false alarm on a doc whose
 * board is fine would teach people to ignore the line.
