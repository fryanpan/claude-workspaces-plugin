/**
 * The wide modal a long or decision-bearing thread opens in.
 *
 * The balloon column is 300px and the card that lands in it is sometimes a
 * whole conversation or a decision with option buttons under it. Above the
 * threshold in `long-thread.ts` the thread stops expanding in place and opens
 * here instead: same card, room to read it.
 *
 * The card is `ThreadPanel.renderThread` — the ONE builder behind the drawer
 * row, the margin balloon, the mobile inline card and the sheet — reused
 * rather than reimplemented, so reply / resolve / reopen / re-anchor and the
 * whole review-item interface behave identically here. That is also why this
 * module takes `renderCard` rather than a panel: it renders nothing of its own
 * and has no opinion about what a thread looks like.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a second expand authority. The panel's active thread is
 * still the one state, and the chrome sets it when it opens this — the modal
 * only forces its own copy open so a caller that forgets cannot produce a
 * folded card inside a dialog.
 *
 * Desktop and tablet only. Below 1100px a comment already opens as a
 * full-width inline card with the over-doc sheet behind it, and a modal on top
 * of a sheet is two dismissable layers over one conversation. The width test
 * lives with the caller (`inlineCardsVisible`), which is the thing that knows.
