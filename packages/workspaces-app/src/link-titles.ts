/**
 * Resolve pasted workspace URLs to display titles and status chips — the
 * async half of the "a raw link reads as its title" feature.
 *
 * The renderer (`comment-markdown.ts`) stays synchronous: it emits an anchor
 * whose visible text is the raw URL (or the author's own label, marked
 * `data-ws-custom`), marked `data-ws-link` (+ `data-ws-pending` until
 * resolved), and calls `scheduleLinkTitleHydration`. A beat later this module
 * gathers every pending anchor in the document into route-sized
 * `POST /workspaces/<ws>/links:titles` batches, caches the answers, swaps each bare
 * anchor's TEXT for its title, and appends a status chip when the target is a
 * task or goal (a custom label keeps its words and still gets the chip). The
 * href — and the stored comment — keep the raw URL: conversion is
 * display-only, so it stays correct when a title changes and never rewrites
 * user content.
 *
 * Failure is always the raw URL: an unknown id caches as null and renders as
 * itself; a failed lookup leaves the anchors pending, so a later render
 * retries. Nothing here ever throws into a render path.
