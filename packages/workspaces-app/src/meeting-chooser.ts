 *
 * EVERY BILLED CHOICE IS MADE HERE. A streaming session's configuration IS
 * its connect URL, so source (microphone, or a bot sent to a call) and how
 * many voices the room has are settled before `start` and cannot move after
 * it. The one exception is this file's other half: AssemblyAI can take some
 * of its turn-detection knobs on the open socket, which is what `sendTune`
 * is, and every knob it cannot take says "next recording" under itself.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT OWN THE STATE IT WRITES. `ChooserState` is the strip's, passed
 * in — the strip reads the same fields when the Start press is finally
 * handled, and the fetch that settles the engine writes one of them. The rest
 * of what these builders reach for arrives as `MeetingChooserDeps` rather
 * than as a captured closure, which is why they could leave the mount at all.
