/**
 * The transcript feed: the one line under the Record button where a meeting's
 * words appear, and every note that stands in for them when there are none.
 * Split out of `meeting-strip.ts` (split-plan B4's follow-on), which keeps the
 * socket state machine that decides WHICH of those the line should be showing.
 *
 * IT IS THE ONLY PLACE THE WORDS ARE. The transcript is never written into the
 * document while a meeting runs, so a state the strip can be left in — a mic
 * that was refused, a server with no transcription key, a bot that left — has
 * to arrive here as a sentence. That is why `showNote` sits beside
 * `renderFeed` rather than in the strip: the note and the words are the same
 * slot, and only one of them can be in it.
 *
 * CORRECTIONS LAND ON THE WORD ALREADY ON SCREEN. A `transcript` frame carries
 * the WHOLE turn as currently understood, so a later frame for the same turn
 * is the engine revising itself. `diffTurnWords` finds which words actually
 * moved and only those are rewritten and flashed — redrawing the line instead
 * would make every partial look like a correction. The per-turn spans that
 * makes possible are this module's own state; nothing outside it holds them.
 *
 * IT OWNS NO DECISIONS. Everything it reads — which state the machine is in,
 * what the turns are, whether a bot is live, what a voice is called — arrives
 * as `MeetingFeedDeps` accessors read at call time, because every one of them
 * is a `let` the strip moves. The one verb it offers back, a tap on a speaker
 * tag, is handed straight to the strip's `nameSpeaker`.
