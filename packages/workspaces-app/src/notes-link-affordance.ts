/**
 * The two taps a meeting note's links can take: accept a question, and undo a
 * link that was wrong.
 *
 * THE QUESTION. The note-taker writes "related: Volume buttons?" as an
 * ordinary markdown link whose href carries `suggest=1`
 * (`core/note-suggestion.ts`). Tapping it writes the ref onto the row and
 * rewrites the words in place, so the question becomes the citation it was
 * asking about. Nothing else in the doc changes and nothing new is inserted —
 * the link the reader tapped IS the link they end up with, which is why this
 * needs no chip, no caption and no confirm step. Links in this editor are
 * non-navigable on a plain click already, so the tap was free.
 *
 * THE UNDO, and why it is only on rows that have a ref. The matcher answers
 * from a loose description and will sometimes answer wrong, so a wrong link
 * has to be removable — and removable in a way that takes the ROW's side with
 * it, or the doc stops citing a task that still lists the doc. The control is
 * a widget beside the link, and it is drawn only where this doc actually
 * holds a ref, which is read from the doc's own backlink surface. So an
 * ordinary pasted task link carries nothing, and a control that appears is
 * always a control with something to undo.
 *
 * UNDOING KEEPS THE WORDS. It removes the ref and the link mark, not the
 * sentence: the composer weaves a row's title into the middle of a note
 * ("we sized the volume buttons again"), and deleting the text to remove a
 * citation would take a clause of somebody's meeting record with it. What was
 * said stays; what is no longer claimed is the link.
