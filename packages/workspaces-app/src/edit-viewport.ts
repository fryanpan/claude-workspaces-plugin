/**
 * Editing a document while an on-screen keyboard is up.
 *
 * Two defects, both reported by Bryan from an iPhone after tapping a table
 * cell in an attachment: *"the keyboard and voice recording panel moved up to
 * cover what I'm editing. I don't need the voice recording panel while
 * editing and the screen should also scroll up to show the point being
 * edited"*.
 *
 * 1. THE MEETING STRIP YIELDS. It is `#shell`'s second grid row, fused under
 *    the topbar, so at phone width it costs the prose 36px on top of whatever
 *    the keyboard already takes — and it is the one thing on that screen with
 *    nothing to say while somebody types. So while an editor holds focus at
 *    phone width the strip gives its row back.
 *
 *    It yields in CSS, never by unmounting: `stripYield` publishes a mode on
 *    `<body>` and the stylesheet reads it. The strip's state machine, its
 *    socket and any in-progress capture never learn this happened, which is
 *    what keeps a live huddle recording through an edit. It is also why the
 *    yield is NOT `root.hidden` — that attribute already means "no meeting
 *    surface is available here" (meeting-strip.ts), and overloading it would
 *    make a yielded strip indistinguishable from an unavailable one, with the
 *    strip's own availability logic free to un-yield it at any moment.
 *
 *    A RECORDING strip never disappears — a live mic with no indicator is not
 *    a thing to ship. `stripYield` publishes `compact` for it, and no rule
 *    consumes that mode: the whole 36px line stays, clear of the keyboard.
 *
 * 2. THE CARET STAYS ABOVE THE KEYBOARD. Nothing scrolled to follow it. iOS
 *    does not shrink the LAYOUT viewport for the keyboard, so `#editor` still
 *    extends behind it and the browser's own scroll-into-view has no reason
 *    to fire. `caretScrollDelta` measures the caret against the band the
 *    visual viewport says is actually visible and scrolls `#editor` — by
 *    hand, for the same reason `mobile-review.ts` does: `scrollIntoView()`
 *    walks up and moves every ancestor scroller too.
 *
 *    The LAST LINE of a long doc is the case a delta alone cannot fix — the
 *    scroller is already at its maximum, so there is nothing left to scroll.
 *    The runway comes from the stylesheet: `#editor`'s bottom padding grows
 *    by `--kb-bottom`, so the document gains exactly as much scrollable room
 *    as the keyboard took. `caretScrollDelta` clamps to the range that
 *    padding produces rather than promising a scroll that cannot happen.
