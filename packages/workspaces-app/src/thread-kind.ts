 * What a thread IS to the reader, in one word — the term every surface keys
 * its glyph off: the highlight in the prose, the card in the margin, the
 * inline card on a phone, the top-bar chip and the off-screen hints.
 *
 *  - `question`  an open review item is waiting on a person. Decisions and
 *                questions alike: Bryan's one change on the approved mock was
 *                ONE question-mark glyph for every review item, no separate
 *                fork glyph for a decision (2026-09-01).
 *  - `answered`  the thread carried an item and somebody has answered it.
 *  - `resolved`  the thread is closed.
 *  - `comment`   everything else — an ordinary conversation.
 *
 * Ordered by what the reader has to DO: a resolved thread that once carried a
 * question is resolved, not answered, because nothing is left to do with it.
