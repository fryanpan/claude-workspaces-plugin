 * a test environment has no audio hardware and the parts that are easy to get

 *
 * WHY THE BROWSER RESAMPLES. An AudioContext runs at the device's rate — 44.1k
 * or 48k, and on some hardware neither — and the engine wants
 * `MEETING_SAMPLE_RATE`. Doing it here means the socket carries one format
 * whatever machine opened it, so the server never has to ask what it is
 * receiving, and the audio that crosses the network is a third of the size.
 *
 * The secure-context gate and the messages come from `voice-capture.ts`: this
 * is the same microphone, blocked by the same rule, and a second wording of
 * "the mic needs https or localhost" would be a second thing to keep true.

 * — one microphone on a table with people around it. The figure is the one
 * that survives a change of denominator: reference words BOTH transcribed and
 * attributed to the person who said them, over every word said in the window.
 * (Attribution over the part a run covered cannot rank settings, because each
 * setting produces a different transcript and so covers a different amount.)
 *
 *     two people, 120s     raw 16.4%   ns 34.4%   agc 13.4%   ns+agc 16.4%
 *     four people, 120s    raw 27.3%   ns 29.5%   agc 31.8%   ns+agc 49.0%
 *
 * NOISE SUPPRESSION ON beats noise suppression off in all four pairings —
 * both windows, gain control either way. That one is not close and it is not
 * split.
 *
 * GAIN CONTROL IS SPLIT, and the honest reading is that it depends on how
 * many people are in the room. On two voices it costs (13.4 against 16.4, and
 * it cancels the whole of noise suppression's gain: 16.4 against 34.4); on
 * four it helps (31.8 against 27.3, and the best row of the eight). A
 * mechanism fits both halves: telling people apart on ONE microphone leans on
 * how loud each of them is, so removing that difference costs when two voices
 * are already separable and pays when four voices are so unequal that the
 * quiet ones are lost entirely.
 *
 * So this default is chosen for the room this product is FOR — two people
 * with a device on the table — and not by a majority of the eight numbers. A
 * bigger room wants `?mic=ec1-ns1-agc1`, which is exactly why the knob is on
 * the address.
 *
 * Echo cancellation stays on and UNMEASURED: it cancels what the device's own
 * speaker is playing, and an AMI recording has no far-end signal to cancel,
 * so no run here says anything about it either way.
 *
 * These were ffmpeg approximations of a browser's processors, on two windows
 * of one meeting. Bryan's own recording is what confirms them; moving this
