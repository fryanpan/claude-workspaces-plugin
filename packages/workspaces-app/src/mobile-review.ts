 * There is no standalone comment drawer on a phone. Two surfaces:
 *
 *  1. **Inline** — the card sits directly under the text (or the source line)
 *     it points at, exactly where a GitHub PR comment sits. Only threads that
 *     have a line to sit beside appear here: open, with a resolvable anchor.
 *  2. **The over-doc sheet** — what the app bar's comment-count badge opens.
 *     Grouped Open / Orphaned / Resolved. This is the ONLY place an orphaned
 *     or resolved thread appears, because neither has an anchor to sit under.
 *
 * `‹ ›` in the app bar, to the LEFT of the badge, walk the inline cards in
 * document order. A thread with no inline position cannot be walked — the
 * buttons go disabled rather than landing the reader on nothing.
 *
 * Expand state is SHARED between a thread's inline copy and its sheet copy:
 * this module never touches a card's expansion directly, it goes through the
 * panel's active thread, which folds every copy on screen at once.
