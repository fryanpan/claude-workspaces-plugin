 * five times over and had to click to find out which tab was which. Leading
 * with the doc / workspace name puts the varying half where the reader can
 * see it and lets the product name be the part that gets cut.
 *
 * ` · ` rather than an em dash, because that is the separator the
 * server-rendered titles already use (`<project> · Workspaces`,
 * `Doc not found · Workspaces`) and two conventions would read as a bug.
