 * configured. `packages/server/src/browser-sentry.ts` is the other half and
 * carries the reasoning: why it is a separate script rather than an
 * `import()` inside app.js / board.js / the widget, and why the page type is a
 * TAG rather than something read back off the URL.
 *
 * It is a side-effecting module on purpose. There is no export anything else
 * imports, and nothing waits for it: a module script runs in document order,
 * so this one — emitted in `<head>` — has already called `Sentry.init` by
 * the time the page's own bundle executes. That is also what puts the
 * pageload transaction's start as early as the browser can see it.
