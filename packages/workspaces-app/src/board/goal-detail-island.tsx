/**
 * The goal detail panel — the band a reader opens to see what the goal is for,
 * declare it done or argue about it — as a Preact island.
 *
 * `renderGoalDetail` rebuilt the whole panel with `replaceChildren()` on every
 * repaint, and the board repaints on every SSE event. Everything the panel was
 * HOLDING died with each rebuild, so each rescue had to be hand-built against
 * the one-line window either side of the swap:
 *
 *   - `keepFields` / `restoreFields` snapshotted a half-typed rename out of the
 *     doomed DOM and wrote it back into the fresh one, caret and all;
 *   - `keptBodySlot` found the live description editor's node, and the renderer
 *     then patched AROUND it — inserting `before` above it and appending
 *     `after` below — because even MOVING that node detaches a ProseMirror view
 *     from the document and drops the caret;
 *   - a `title.click()` at the very end reopened a rename the repaint had just
 *     closed, so `restoreFields` had somewhere to put the draft back.
 *
 * All three are gone. `GoalDetailPanel` is keyed on the goal's id, so a repaint
 * of the SAME goal reuses the instance and its DOM: the title survives because
 * it survives, and the slot is simply never rebuilt. Moving to another goal
 * changes the key, which unmounts the panel — so the next one opens with an
 * empty box and nothing of its predecessor, which is the other half of the
 * guarantee.
 *
 * The bridge is one-directional, as in the board, task-detail, Home-review,
 * presence and walkthrough islands: `renderDetail` in board-app still owns the
 * fetches and the projection and writes them into `goalDetailData`; the island
 * only reads. The HANDLERS ride the signal rather than being bound at mount,
 * for the walkthrough's reason — they close over the section and the clock this
 * paint resolved.
 *
 * Two kinds of node are deliberately not Preact's children, for the same reason
 * they are not in the task panel: an element with no vnode children is diffed
 * against nothing, so Preact never reaches inside it.
 *
 *   - the title `<h2>` — `wireInPlaceTitle` swaps its text for an `<input>`
 *     mid-rename;
 *   - the description slot — the live Tiptap editor mounts INTO it.
 *
 * The HEAD carries the task panel's action set — copy link, full screen,
 * archive/restore, close — because a goal is a row like any other and being
 * the one row whose menu is short is not a design, it is an omission (Bryan,
 * 2026-08-29: *"goals should have the same additional extra actions that tasks
 * do like being able to Archive get a link and so on"*). The share and
 * full-screen controls used to be listed here as deliberate absences; they
 * were not, and the goal panel has the same long description and the same
 * discussion the task panel expands for.
 *
 * Archive is the one that is not simply the task panel's, one row over: it
 * takes the band's tasks with it, so it asks first and says how many. See
 * `archiveConfirmLine`.
 *
 * What this panel still deliberately does NOT have, and the task panel does:
 * tabs, a review queue, a transition history. A goal has no transitions worth
 * a second tab, so its conversation sits directly under the description where
 * a reader on a short screen reaches it by scrolling rather than by finding a
 * control.
