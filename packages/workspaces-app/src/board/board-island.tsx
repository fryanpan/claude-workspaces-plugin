/**
 * The board — the goal bands and their task rows — as a Preact island.
 *
 * This is the surface the migration was aimed at. The vanilla `renderBoard`
 * emptied its container and rebuilt every band and every row on every paint,
 * and the board repaints constantly: a peer's transition over the ydoc, an
 * SSE `thread.*`, an attachment refresh, the reader's own status pick. So
 * anything a row was holding died with it — an in-flight rename, a focused
 * row halfway through an Alt+Arrow sequence, an open native picker, the
 * half-typed title in "New goal".
 *
 * Rows are keyed on the TASK ID and bands on the goal id — the two ids that
 * survive a re-fetch, a reconnect and a reorder — so an unchanged row is the
 * IDENTICAL DOM node across a signal update. That single property is what
 * every fix below reduces to.
 *
 * The bridge is one-directional, as in the Home review and presence islands:
 * `renderBoardRegion` still owns the projection, the filters and the
 * attachment list, and writes them into `boardData`; the island only reads.
 * The stable callbacks are bound once at mount; the values that change per
 * paint (sections, the agent list, the archived count, which pane is showing)
 * ride the signal, because a handler object bound at mount would be answering
 * with the agent list as it stood at boot.
 *
 * What stays vanilla and why: `renderArchivedList` is a different list with a
 * different anatomy and it now renders into its own container, because no
 * vanilla code may `replaceChildren` a node holding a live island.

 * Whether the box is open is component state, and that is the whole reason
 * this row is in the island. Under the vanilla renderer it was a pair of
 * `hidden` classes on nodes the next repaint destroyed: any background event
 * — a peer's transition, an SSE thread, the 30s attachment poll — closed the
 * box and threw away what had been typed into it, so "+ New goal" regularly
