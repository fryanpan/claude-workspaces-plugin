/**
 * The task description, edited in place.
 *
 * A task's body is not a field on the row — it is a live Yjs doc
 * (`task:<taskId>`), the same one an agent rewrites through
 * `set_doc_content` / `find_and_replace` and the same one the full review
 * surface opens. This mounts the review surface's own editor over that doc
 * inside the detail panel, so a person's typing and an agent's rewrite merge
 * as CRDT edits rather than one overwriting the other, and the description
 * is edited where it is read instead of on a second page.
 *
 * The editor is loaded lazily: the board bundle is a board, and the whole
 * Tiptap/ProseMirror stack would triple it for a panel most page loads never
 * open. `loadEditor` is a dynamic import at the call site, so it becomes its
 * own chunk.
 *
 * Lifecycle is keyed on (task, slot). The panel repaints on every ydoc change
 * and keeps the slot element in place for a live description (the detail
 * islands render it childless, so Preact never reaches inside it and never
 * replaces it) — so a repaint with the same task and the
 * same slot is a no-op here, and only a different task, a rebuilt slot, or a
 * closed panel tears the editor down. That is what lets a reader keep typing
 * through their own snapshot landing in the projection.
