/**
 * One line per page load: how long the board took to appear, and how long

 *
 * One responsibility, and it is measurement rather than boot. "The board is
 * slow on the iPad" was a memory until the server grew `/load-reports`; this
 * is the client half, and the reason it is a module of its own is that its
 * two numbers mean nothing apart. `msToBoot` is the REST first paint;
 * `msToFirstProjection` is when the ydoc's task projection was on screen —
 * the payload that spent those ten seconds — and never before the first
 * paint, since a sync that lands first is only visible once that paint draws it. Both are ms from navigation
 * start (`performance.now()`'s zero), so they compare across loads, and a
 * report carrying one without the other cannot say which phase was slow.
 *
 * `bootBoard` keeps the two stamps and the sent-once guard, because WHEN each
 * phase ends is a fact about the boot sequence. What is here is what a report
 * contains and where it goes.
