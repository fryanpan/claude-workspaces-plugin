/**
 * The review walkthrough — one waiting item at a time, with the way out at
 * every step — as a Preact island.
 *
 * This is the card Bryan spends the most time in front of, and it is the one
 * the vanilla renderer treated worst. `renderReviewWalkthrough` began with
 * `container.replaceChildren()`, and the board repaints this surface on every
 * SSE event — a task moving, a thread arriving, a presence tick — so on a busy
 * board the card the reader was working was rebuilt every second or two.
 * Everything the card was HOLDING died with it, and each rescue had to be
 * hand-built: `keepFields`/`restoreFields` for the drafts, and (0.1.100) a
 * snapshot of two expansion states read off the DOM a line before it was
 * thrown away. Bryan, 2026-08-24 — "when I expand a task, it collapses a
 * second later."
 *
 * Keyed components fix all three at the root. `WalkCard` is keyed on
 * `ReviewItem.key`, so an unchanged item keeps its component instance AND its
 * DOM across a repaint:
 *
 *   - the two expansions are real component state (`useState`) rather than a
 *     snapshot off the DOM — the `data-walk-expanded` / `data-walk-item`
 *     machinery is gone, because it only ever existed as a place to put state
 *     the vanilla renderer had nowhere else to keep;
 *   - an uncontrolled `<textarea>` that keeps its node keeps its value for
 *     free, so the drafts need no `keepFields` pass at all;
 *   - moving to another item changes the key, which unmounts the card — so the
 *     next one opens the way its author wrote it, with an empty box, which is
 *     the other half of the guarantee.
 *
 * The bridge is one-directional, as in the board, Home-review and presence
 * islands: `renderWalkthrough` in board-app still owns the queue, the position
 * and the sitting's tally, and writes them into `walkthroughData`; the island
 * only reads. It fetches nothing and subscribes to nothing.
 *
 * The one departure from the other islands: the HANDLERS ride the signal
 * rather than being bound at mount. They are not stable here — `onAnswer` and
 * `onReply` close over the item this paint drew and the one after it, which is
 * what makes the advance land on the right card — so a set bound at boot would
 * be answering about a queue several answers old. Same reasoning as the board
 * island's `knownAgentIds`: what changes per paint travels on the signal.

 * disposal is `render(null, el)`, and no vanilla code may `replaceChildren` or
 * `innerHTML` a container holding the live island.
 *
 * No handlers here: they change with every paint (see the head of the file)
 * and travel on `walkthroughData` instead.
