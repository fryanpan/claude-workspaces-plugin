 * Everything waiting on a person, in ONE priority order.

 * The other two kinds were in the store and unreachable from the surface —
 * the failure this codebase has been bitten by before, and the one that
 * presents as the worst possible bug because nothing is actually lost.
 *
 * **Task priority is the primary key** (Bryan, 2026-08-18, answering
 * on the ask-ordering ticket: *"Always order asks by task priority"*). That question was
 * filed precisely because two sort keys disagreed with no stated tiebreak —
 * a P1 asked five hours ago against a P3 that has waited two days — and the
 * standing lean was the opposite, waiting time first inside a priority band.
 * His answer settles it the other way, so priority is the band and the wait
 * is the tiebreak inside it.
 *
 * Priority means the BOARD's order and nothing invented here: goal band
 * first, then the task's own position in it (`goalRank` + `byBoardOrder`).
 * There is deliberately no priority FIELD to set — the board's order already
 * is the priority, so a second one would immediately disagree with the list
 * Bryan drags rows around in.
 *
 * Three consequences worth stating, because each replaces a rule this
 * function used to apply as a primary key:
 *
 *  - **Kind is no longer a band.** A decision and a comment about
 *    the same task now sit together, in that order; asks about a
 *    higher-priority task all come first. Previously every decision on the
 *    board outranked every comment regardless of what either was about.
 *  - **Oldest-first survives only as a tiebreak.** It still orders the
 *    comments on one task, which is where the starvation it protects against
 *    actually happens (an agent's follow-ups burying its own question — see
 *    `since` in review-queue.ts). Across tasks it would contradict the
 *    instruction, so it does not apply there.
 *  - **`direct` likewise.** A question still outranks a status note, but only
 *    among asks of equal task priority.
 *
 * An ask with no task priority — a doc comment, or a task discussion whose
 * task is not in `tasks` — sorts after every ask that has one, keeping the
 * question-first, then oldest-first rule among themselves. That is not a
 * shelf: a doc read still rides in the one queue and the one walkthrough
 * (Bryan, same answer: *"it's okay to mix in 15-30 minute doc reads with
 * quick decisions"*). It is simply the only defined place for an item the
 * primary key cannot speak about.
 *
 * `goals` is optional so a caller that has no goal list still gets a total
 * order — every task then lands in one band and ranks by board order alone,
 * which is a degraded ordering rather than a wrong one.
 */
/**
 * This task's rows, as the DETAIL PANEL is allowed to use them.
 *
 * Rows are matched by `taskId` — a doc-thread row has none and correctly

 * `reviewQueue` holds for the Home queue: it needs the two ids its answer
 * posts to and the payload the card renders, and the DERIVED legacy row
 * (`r-legacy`) stays out because the task's own `needs: 'decision'` already
 * renders that question as the panel's first card — admitting the copy would
 * put a second set of option buttons under the live ones.
 *
 * This held the kind back wholesale until 2026-08-29, from when the panel
 * answered every card by commenting on `item.threadId` — a ticket-borne row
 * has none, so its buttons would have filed a stray comment and recorded
 * nothing. The Home queue admitted the kind on 2026-08-24, and opening one
