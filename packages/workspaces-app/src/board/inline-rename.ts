/**

 * requirement that an `<input>` cannot satisfy structurally (Bryan,
 * 2026-08-21): *"Entering edit mode must NOT shift the text — zero layout
 * jump."* Swapping a span for an input means matching font, weight,
 * line-height, padding, border and baseline between two different box types,
 * and getting it right today says nothing about the next font change —
 * `.board-title-input` currently adds 4px of padding and a 1px border, which is
 * exactly the 5px sideways jump this replaces. Here the element, its text node
 * and its box are never replaced at all: one attribute changes. Zero shift is
 * then a property of the DOM rather than a number two rules have to agree on.
 *
 * The second thing it buys is Asana's transition — the hover rectangle is on
 * this same element, so it can simply turn off while editing and leave the
 * reader with nothing but a caret in the text they clicked.
 *
 * `isEditing` comes back alongside the starter because a caller that OWNS the
 * element's text — a Preact row, which rewrites it on every repaint — has to
 * know when to keep its hands off. Nothing else can answer that: the edit
 * state lives in this closure, and a rename in flight is exactly the moment a
 * declarative text write would eat what is being typed.
