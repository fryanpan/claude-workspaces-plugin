/**
 * The board pane: the bands and rows, the lead strip, the restore list, and
 * the Activity feed that is a VIEW of this same pane rather than a page of
 * its own — as is the Library, which paints itself and is only shown here.
 *
 * One responsibility — everything the middle column can be showing — and the
 * reason the Activity feed belongs in it is `state.view`: the feed and the
 * task list are two states of one container, and the three chrome elements
 * that hide with the rows (`board-quick`, `board-decisions`, `board-archived`) are
 * hidden by the same function that swaps them. Split apart, "which of these is
 * on screen" would live in two files with nothing keeping them agreed.
 *
 * `boardHandlers` is here rather than in the entry for the same reason: it is
 * the stable callback set the board island is mounted with, and every one of
 * its entries is a board gesture. `openTaskDetail` travels with it because it
 * is the ONE opener behind every task tap — a board row, a queue row and the
 * Home activity pane all reach the panel through it, with only the landing tab
 * differing, which is what keeps them from drifting into three openers.
 *
 * `BoardDeps` is the whole list of what this pane may reach. The REST verbs
 * arrive as one `actions` object rather than as loose functions, because the
 * pane performs no writes of its own — it hands the island a gesture and the
 * verb decides.
