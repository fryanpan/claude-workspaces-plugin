/**
 * The task panel's two one-tap asks: Plan and Review.
 *
 * A huddle doc has these as floating buttons (`plan-gate.ts`,
 * `review-float.ts`) and a ticket had only the receipts — "Plan requested"
 * rendered as a dead, disabled button for an ask somebody had made
 * somewhere else. This is the live half: on a ticket, Plan asks the board's
 * agent to plan the work, Review asks it to read the ticket back and
 * question what is thin.
 *
 * The ask IS a comment, exactly as it is on a doc. A ticket's comments live
 * in its body doc (`task:<id>`), so a press posts to the same routes the
 * floats press — `POST /api/docs/task:<id>/plan-request` and
 * `.../review-request` — which file a subject thread from the presser and
 * stamp the doc with who asked and when. Nothing new for the seated lead to
 * learn: it already hears the board's threads.
 *
 * This module is the decision layer and nothing else — no fetches, no DOM —
 * so the face, the receipt words and the address are each testable on their
 * own. The panel renders what `taskAskFace` says; `board-app.ts` performs the
 * write.
