/**
 * The Home "Recent activity" pane, as a Preact island beside the review
 * queue — what is happening to the work, grouped BY TASK, never by agent
 * (Bryan, 2026-08-29: "I don't care who's doing the work, I care about the
 * work"). Sits under "For Your Review" and above "What's New?".
 *
 * Same bridge the review island rides: the vanilla loader owns the fetch and
 * writes the projected tasks it already holds into `homeActivityData`; the
 * island derives the groups (`homeActivity`, the pure model) and renders
 * them. No fetches, no subscriptions of its own; a background event's signal
 * write still waits for the reader's finger through the repaint-guard.
 *
 * Every group's title line ends in a QUIET PILL: how long since that task's
 * newest activity (Bryan, 2026-09-11). On an in-progress task it turns to a
 * warning past half an hour and to an error past an hour — the keep-moving
 * protocol's check-in, made visible where the work is listed. It is the only
 * marker a `dark` group wears, because it says the same thing.
 *
 * One action only: commenting on a phrase of a note line or of the title,
 * doc-style. The lines are plain text — not buttons — so a selection can
 * land on them (and a tap on a word selects it); the walkthrough card's
 * comment pill appears beside the words; tapping it opens the REAL thread
 * card (`thread-card.tsx`, shared with the task panel's Activity feed)
 * beside the group, or under it on a narrow viewport, quoting the phrase. The header row is the only other tap, and
 * it opens the task. No hover hints, no comment box, no counters.
 *
 * Groups are keyed on the task id, so a signal write that changes one task's
 * lines leaves every other group's DOM node IDENTICAL.
