/**
 * The three REST reads the board keeps making, and the repaints they arm.
 *
 * One responsibility: everything the board learns from the server AFTER the
 * ydoc projection — the review-items list, the attachment/presence/release
 * read, and the audit log. They belong together because they share one rule
 * that is easy to break in isolation: **a read that never reached the server
 * is not an empty answer.** All three go through `applyRefresh`, so a restart
 * leaves the last good list on screen instead of emptying the presence row,
 * the review strip and the activity feed at once.
 *
 * The second shared rule is the repaint. Each load ends in
 * `schedule(<a stable closure>)` rather than calling the renders directly:
 * these fire constantly (SSE `agent.heartbeat` alone arrives every few
 * seconds) and iOS Safari drops a synthetic click when the element under the
 * finger is replaced mid-press. The three closures below are module-level
 * consts precisely so the guard can coalesce a burst during one press into a
 * single repaint — a fresh arrow per call would defeat that, which is why they
 * are not inlined.
 *
 * `eventsConsumerActive` is the third rule and the reason `loadEvents` lives
 * here rather than beside the Activity view: the log is ~1000 rows (~590KB on
 * the live board) and only two surfaces read it, so the gate belongs at the
 * fetch, where every SSE caller passes through it, not at each call site.
 *
 * `BoardLoadDeps` is the whole list of what these reads may reach.
