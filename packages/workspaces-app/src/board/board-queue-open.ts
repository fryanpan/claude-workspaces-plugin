/**
 * Where a review-queue row goes when it is opened.
 *
 * One responsibility: turn an item on the queue into the place the reader can
 * answer it. Five kinds of row land in one list — a decision on a ticket, a
 * ticket-borne review item, a thread on a task, a thread on a goal band, and a
 * comment on a document — and each of the five has a different "there". Read
 * scattered through `bootBoard` they were three functions among forty; read
 * together they are the whole of "exactly the place where I need to review and
 * make the choice", which is the queue's reason for existing.
 *
 * The shared return contract is the second reason these belong in one file:
 * every opener answers whether the reader is STILL ON THIS PAGE afterwards.
 * Only the doc jump answers false, and the walkthrough keys its card repaint
 * on that answer — a repaint after `location.assign` paints over a page that
 * is leaving.
 *
 * `BoardQueueOpenDeps` is the whole list of what an opener may reach. It opens a
 * task only through `boardHandlers.onOpenTask` — the ONE opener behind every
 * task tap — so a queue row and a board row open a panel the same way.
