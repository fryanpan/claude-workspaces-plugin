/**
 * The Preact islands this page mounts ONCE, and the stable handlers they keep.
 *
 * One responsibility, and it is a lifetime rather than a feature: every island
 * below owns a wrapper inside its host from the moment it is mounted, and no
 * vanilla code may wipe that host again (the contract `island-probe.tsx`
 * states). So all seven mounts happen here, in one place, immediately after
 * `buildShell` — the last vanilla write of `#board-root` — and each is a mount
 * rather than a render because everything an island holds that the DOM does
 * not (a half-typed answer, an expansion the reader opened, a long-press in
 * progress, focus on a keyed row) used to die with the nodes each repaint
 * replaced. What changes per paint travels through the signals instead, from
 * the region modules.
 *
 * `#board` is deliberately NOT here: it is mounted at the very bottom of
 * boot, after the deep-link arming, because its host is the one the restore
 * list used to share and the ordering of that mount is load-bearing.
 *
 * `BoardIslandDeps` is the whole list of what a handler may reach. Every verb on
 * it arrives as a thunk: the islands mount before the regions and the review
 * controller are built, and a handler is only ever called by a tap long after
 * boot has finished — which is exactly the cycle a thunk exists to resolve.
