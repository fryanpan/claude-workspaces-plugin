/**
 * The parts both detail panels are made of.
 *
 * These moved out of `task-detail-island.tsx` when the GOAL panel became an
 * island too. A goal's panel is not a smaller task panel — no tabs, no review
 * queue, no transitions — but the three pieces below are the same problem in
 * both, and they are the pieces where getting it wrong loses somebody's words:
 *
 *   - `useFill`, for content that holds no state and is cheapest rebuilt;
 *   - the composer, which must stay imperative because
 *     `attachMarkdownComposer` re-parents the textarea Preact thinks it owns;
 *   - `Discussion`, which is one stream and one box in both panels.
 *
 * `Discussion` takes a ROW ID rather than a task. A goal's comments live in
 * `task:<goalId>` and travel the same route, so the only thing the component
 * ever needed off the task was its id — the draft's identity and the post's
 * destination. Taking the id makes that literal instead of implied.

/**
 * The task's Discussion: ONE chronological sequence of comments, and ONE
 * composer at the bottom.
 *
 * This is the whole point of the panel for a reviewer: the board used to
 * offer a LINK to the task doc and nothing else, so disagreeing with a task
 * cost a navigation — which in practice meant saying it in chat instead,
 * where it reaches nobody the task reaches.
 *
 * Three rounds of the same complaint got it here, each removing a layer of
 * threading from the SURFACE. First there were N + 1 composers — a reply box
 * inside every thread plus a new-thread box under them all. Then one composer,
 * with each thread still drawn as its own bordered box. Then one stream of
 * rows, but with a Reply button per conversation, a "Replying below" state and
 * a "New thread" button. Bryan, 2026-08-18, on that last one: *"Mocks still
 * show threaded comments design. I explicitly asked for that to be removed."*
 *
 * So there is now no threading affordance at all: no reply target to choose,
 * nothing naming a thread, no way to start one by hand. What a reader sees is
 * what they were promised — *"a single sequence of comments with clearer
 * separation, authorship and timing"* — and the composer's destination is
 * DERIVED (`composerTarget`) rather than picked.
 *
 * Storage did not move, and deliberately: threads remain exactly as
 * `create_thread` writes them (34 of 37 on the live board carry a text anchor
 * into the description) and `resolve_thread` still means "this point is
 * handled". Flattening the render is reversible; flattening the store would
 * destroy the anchors and redefine an MCP verb that has callers. Nothing in
 * this render reads a thread's identity except `data-thread-id`, which is data
 * rather than presentation — it is how a reply reaches the agent watching that
 * conversation.
 *
 * The rows hold no state, so they are rebuilt on every paint into an `<ol>`
 * Preact owns and never reaches into; the composer beneath them keeps its
 * node, which is what keeps the draft.
