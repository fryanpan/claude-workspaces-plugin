 * A row's comments: where they live, how they are read, and how one is posted.
 *
 * One responsibility, and the reason it is one is the sentence the inline
 * version buried: a row's comments live in its BODY doc — `task:<id>` for a
 * task and for a goal alike — so this is the ordinary thread API pointed at
 * that doc. There is no second store, an agent's `create_thread` writes the
 * same threads, and a GOAL reaches both its discussion and its description
 * editor through the same two functions. Scattered through `bootBoard` that was
 * invisible: `loadDiscussion` sat beside `renderDetail` and read like part of
 * the panel.
 *
 * The keying is the invariant worth reading twice. `state.discussionTaskId` is
 * claimed BEFORE the fetch and re-checked after it, so a load that lands once
 * the reader has moved to another row paints nothing — and claiming it first is
 * also what stops `renderDetail`'s own "fetch if the id differs" from
 * recursing.
 *
 * `BoardDiscussionDeps` is the whole list of what these verbs may reach.
 * `send`, `fetchJson` and `showToast` are not on it: they are the module-level
 * primitives every board write ends in, imported the way `board-actions.ts`
 * exports them.
