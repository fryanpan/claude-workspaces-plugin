/**
 * The real thread card, on a surface that is not the doc: the Home activity
 * pane (beside a task's group) and the task panel's Activity feed (under the
 * row a phrase was selected in). One card component, because the two
 * surfaces hold the same thing — a draft that becomes a posted thread — and
 * had the same bug to solve: a repaint must never eat the words being typed.
 *
 * `ThreadPanel.renderThread` is the one card renderer every surface uses
 * (the drawer, the redline margin, the modal), and it is imperative DOM — so,
 * like the walkthrough's PromptForm, Preact owns the box and the card is
 * built into it in a layout effect.
 *
 * Before the first post the card renders a DRAFT thread (`draftThread`): the
 * reader's own name in the head, the phrase as the topic, no replies, the
 * reply box. Its Reply is what creates the thread; after that the card
 * shows the thread the server returned, and Reply posts to it.
