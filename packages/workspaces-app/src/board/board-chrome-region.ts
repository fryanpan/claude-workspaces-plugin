/**
 * The chrome around the two panes: who is here, what is drifting, who YOU
 * are, and whether the settings panel is open.
 *
 * One responsibility — the top-right cluster and the panel behind its
 * button — and the thing that makes it one is the alarm. A drift notice in a
 * CLOSED panel is an alarm nobody sees, so the same function that writes the
 * notices decides whether the settings button wears its dot. Split into a
 * presence file and a settings file, that rule would have to be re-derived on
 * whichever side did not own it, and the `coverage` exemption (it renders
 * permanently by design, so an always-on dot is one nobody reads) would be a
 * comment in one file about a condition in another.
 *
 * The presence strip renders in TWO places from ONE loader, which is the
 * second reason: who is here goes in the top-right cluster and the drift
 * notices go inside the panel, and both are signal writes made in the same
 * breath from the same awareness read.
 *
 * `BoardChromeDeps` is the whole list of what this region may reach. It cannot
 * see the board's rows at all — presence is a fact about connections, not
 * about tasks.
