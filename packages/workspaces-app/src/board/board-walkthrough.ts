/**
 * The Home walkthrough: where the reader stands in the review queue, what
 * answering a card does to that position, and the one render that draws it.
 *
 * One responsibility, and it is a subtle one. The walk re-derives its queue
 * from the live projection on every render and holds its place as an INDEX
 * plus a KEY rather than as a task id, so that answering the card you are on
 * drops it out of the queue and the same index lands on the next one. Every
 * function here exists to keep that invariant true across a repaint, a
 * history step, and a peer answering the same item from another tab. Read
 * together they are a small state machine; read scattered through `bootBoard`
 * they were four functions that happened to touch the same three fields.
 *
 * What did NOT move is the boot handoff — `chainWalkDrain`, `autoWalkTick`
 * and `walkSources` stay in `bootBoard`, because they are wired from the
 * landing page's `?walk=1` and read by the deep-link deadline at the bottom
 * of boot. The drain reaches this file as `onQueueDrained`, which is the
 * only one of the three the walk itself calls.
 *
 * The store holds no board: `BoardWalkthroughDeps` is the whole list of what a
 * walk verb may reach. The three review-write callbacks arrive as thunks
 * because `createBoardReviewController` takes `render` as one of ITS inputs —
 * the cycle is real and predates this file, and a thunk is how it was
 * already resolved inside the closure.
