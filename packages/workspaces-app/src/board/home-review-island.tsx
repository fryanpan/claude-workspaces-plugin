/**
 * The Home "For Your Review" pane, as the first real Preact island — the
 * vanilla `renderHomeReview` rebuilt on the framework scaffold (island-probe
 * proved the contract; this is the first pane to ride it).
 *
 * The read at the top of Home: what is waiting on you, in priority order,
 * across every surface this workspace has. This replaced a decisions-only
 * strip, then moved from the board to Home; the board keeps only a one-line
 * banner (`renderReviewBanner`). Urgency is still DERIVED, never declared:
 * "blocking work now" is the same fact as "something depends on it", which
 * `after` / `afterEnforce` already record.
 *
 * The bridge is one-directional: the vanilla loader keeps owning the fetch
 * and writes what it fetched into `homeReviewData`; the island renders from
 * that signal and calls back through the same handlers the vanilla renderer
 * took. No fetches, no subscriptions of its own — and because the loaders
 * schedule their repaints through the repaint-guard, a background event's
 * signal write still waits for the reader's finger the way every other
 * repaint does.
 *
 * Rows are keyed on `ReviewItem.key`, which is stable across re-fetches — so
 * an update that changes one row leaves every other row's DOM node IDENTICAL,
 * which is the property this migration exists for (focus survives, and later
 * panes can hold anchors and editor mounts through a repaint).
