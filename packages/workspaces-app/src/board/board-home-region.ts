/**
 * The Home pane: the "What's New?" brief, the review queue and the recent
 * activity feed, plus the three REST calls that feed them.
 *
 * One responsibility, and the seam is the payload rather than the widgets: all
 * four things here are functions of ONE `HomePayload` and the queue derived
 * from the live projection. `loadHome` is the only thing that fetches it,
 * `markCaughtUp` and `saveInstructions` are the two writes that invalidate it
 * (both end by re-loading), and `renderHomeRegion` is the only reader. Split
 * across `bootBoard` that was invisible — the poll that waits for a generated
 * brief sat sixty lines from the render whose emptiness it exists to fill.
 *
 * The generating-brief poll is the invariant worth reading twice. It re-runs
 * `loadHome` every 1.5s while the SERVER says a generation is queued, capped
 * by `shouldPollHome`, and each pass repaints through the guard rather than
 * directly: Home is the surface whose option buttons a mid-press repaint was
 * measured eating (see `createRepaintGuard`).
 *
 * `BoardHomeDeps` is the whole list of what this pane may reach. `send`,
 * `fetchJson` and `showToast` are not on it: they are the module-level
 * primitives every board write ends in, as `board-actions.ts` exports them.
