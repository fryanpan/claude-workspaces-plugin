/**
 * The board's read of the server-owned ydoc projection, and the two headers
 * that must follow it.
 *
 * One responsibility, and the thing that makes it one is the "called from
 * both writers" rule the two syncs carry. `state.info` has exactly two
 * writers — the boot REST fetch and every projection read — so a header
 * painted at one of them is wrong the moment the other fires, and this page
 * never reloads. Keeping the read and the two repaints in one module is what
 * makes that rule checkable by looking at one file.
 *
 * Nothing here mutates the ydoc. The `tasks` / `workspace` Y.Maps are
 * server-owned: the board renders FROM them and writes through the REST gate,
 * which is why this module takes them read-only and returns no setter.
 *
 * `BoardProjectionDeps` is the whole list of what the read may reach.
