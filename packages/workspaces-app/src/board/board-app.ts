/**
 * The workspace board page: a left nav over two panes — Home (the "What's New?"
 * brief, the "For Your Review" queue, and the walkthrough that answers it)
 * and the board (goals as bands, quick add, review banner), with Activity as
 * a view of the board pane. Presence, lead and drift notices live in the
 * settings panel. The board renders in realtime from the ws:<workspaceId>
 * ydoc projection (server-owned `tasks` / `workspace` Y.Maps); every
 * mutation goes through the REST gate — never by writing into the maps,
 * which the server would revert.
 *
 * What is left in THIS file is the boot sequence and the address bar. Every
 * region the boot composes — the board pane, Home, the detail panel, the
 * discussion, the chrome cluster, the islands, the REST reads — is a module
 * that takes `BoardState` plus one explicit dependency object, and hands back
 * the renders the sequence below calls. Read the order of the `const`s in
 * `bootBoard` and you have read the page: nothing between them is a surprise,
 * because a region can only reach what its deps object names.

  // doors below rebuilds its region with `replaceChildren()`, and iOS Safari
  // drops the synthetic click when the element under the finger is replaced
  // between touchstart and touchend — so a background event landing mid-press
  // ate the tap. The guard parks background-triggered repaints during a press
  // and flushes them (coalesced, latest state wins) once the tap completes.
  // The reader's OWN renders are never deferred: the click that carries them
  // ends the window before their handlers run. Sibling of `discussionIsBusy`,
  // which holds the discussion reload the same way for typing.
