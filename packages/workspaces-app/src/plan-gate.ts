/**
 * The plan doc's one floating control — the whole "Make a plan" arc in a
 * single button at the bottom of the editor pane, wearing whichever of four
 * faces the doc has earned:
 *
 *   Make Plan       — a plan doc nobody has asked about yet. Pressing it
 *                     ASKS: it files an ordinary comment from the presser,
 *                     which is how the agent hears (see plan-request on the
 *                     server). On EITHER huddle kind — a discussion turns
 *                     into a plan as often as a planning session does
 *                     (Bryan, 2026-09-01: "there should be a plan button in
 *                     discussions too"). An ordinary doc has no agent
 *                     waiting on a goal, so it gets nothing.
 *   Plan requested  — somebody pressed and the agent has not answered yet.
 *                     Not a control, just the honest state: pressing again is
 *                     allowed, so the button stays live.
 *   Approve Plan    — the doc is a plan whose drafts are held. Keyed on
 *                     `planState` ALONE, not on the huddle kind: an agent can
 *                     mark any doc a pending plan and the approval must show.
 *   ✓ Plan Approved — the few seconds after a press, naming what the release
 *                     actually did. Then it goes away for good.
 *
 * This is the ticket #536 named and left for: the doc page used to carry a
 * one-line bar above the prose ("Plan pending — N draft tasks held") plus a
 * derived-work chip strip; both came out (Bryan, 2026-08-31 — "don't design
 * for plan approval here", "For docs, please depend on links inside the doc
 * — they're there already"). The tasks a doc produced read through the links
 * written in its prose now (task-link-chips.ts decorates those, including
 * the held-draft state), so the only chrome left is this float — anchored to
 * `#editor-pane` rather than the viewport so it stays clear of the doc-list
 * sidebar on desktop.
 *
 * Live like the strip it replaced: one event stream per board the held
 * drafts live on, so an approval from ANYWHERE (another tab, an agent over
 * MCP) releases the drafts, fires their transitions, and this button hides
 * itself rather than offering a stale Approve.
