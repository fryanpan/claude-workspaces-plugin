/**
 * Shared sidebar-render signature. All three sidebar renderers — the diff-nav
 * (`diff-nav.ts`), the folder tree (`workspace-tree.ts`), and the legacy setId
 * list (`app.ts renderSetNav`) — write into the SAME `#set-pane-list` slot, so
 * they must share ONE render-state slot, not one per renderer.
 *
 * The regression this fixes: with a per-renderer key, a stale key from renderer
 * X suppressed a needed rebuild by renderer Y (e.g. Back from a folder-tree
 * workspace to a diff workspace saw the diff key still matching and left the
 * folder tree on screen — wrong tree for the open file).
 *
 * The signature encodes the rendered CONTENT (renderer namespace + workspace +
 * view + the file list's structural identity), NOT badge counts. Renderers
 * re-fetch on every navigation and rebuild the DOM only when the signature
 * changed; an unchanged signature just moves the active marker, preserving the
 * reviewer's scroll. A newly-changed file (or a different workspace) changes the
 * signature and forces the rebuild, so the list stays fresh in place.

/**
 * Reserve (or give back) the sidebar's grid column.
 *
 * Call this with a list you have ALREADY fetched, never with a set id you have
 * merely read off doc meta. `has-set` used to go on the body synchronously
 * from meta, before the fetch that would fill the column — and every failure
 * mode of that fetch left the same artifact. Reported 2026-08-19 on an iPad
 * over the tailnet: *"an empty 'In this review' left panel that still takes up
 * space but has nothing in it"*, then *"in this review loaded in eventually"*.
 * A slow fetch flashed the empty column, a failed one left it there
 * permanently, and a set with no markdown members rendered it with zero rows.
 *
 * The retraction is for a KNOWN-empty list only. A failed refresh must not
 * collapse the column under a reviewer who is reading the rows in it, and a
 * failed FIRST load never committed, so it has nothing to give back.
