 *
 * The mic lives here rather than in `board/board-app.ts` with the nav glyphs
 * because more than one surface mounts a mic — the board's docked one and the
 * capture composer's — and importing `board-app.ts` from outside the board to
 * reach a string would pull the whole board into the doc bundle. (The review
 * doc's own hold-to-talk dock retired with the top-bar overhaul; recording
 * lives behind the Record Audio button now.)
