 * the full transcript sends on release with the per-surface context —
 * `{surface, docId?, taskId?, visibleHeading?}` — and the server's ack (which
 * ALWAYS names what was heard and which route handles it) replaces it.
 *
 * Gesture rules carried from the comment-pill incident (learnings.md): a
 * hold has TWO endings — `pointercancel` fires instead of `pointerup`
 * whenever the system takes the touch over — and both settle the hold the
 * same way. A `blur` (tab switch mid-hold) settles it too, so the mic can
 * never wedge open.
 *
 * A Space this capture has a claim to never scrolls the page: the default is
 * held back at keydown (the only moment that can keep the page still) and a
 * press that turns out to be a tap is paid its page-down back on release. See
 * `onKeyDown` for why the two halves cannot be collapsed into one.

   * 1. The press must land on the PAGE (`spaceHoldTargetsPage`), not on some
   *    focused control. This is what catches the report's worst case: a board
   *    re-render that rebuilds the DOM under someone's hands drops focus to

   *    deliberate hotkey.
   * 2. The press must be a HOLD. keydown only ARMS a timer; the engine starts
   *    SPACE_HOLD_ARM_MS later, and a keyup before that disarms — so a tap
   *    does nothing at all.
   * 3. **A press the page owns does not scroll the page.** Every dictation
   *    used to open with the board jumping a screen, because the native
   *    page-down fires at KEYDOWN and the hold only arms 250ms later — by
   *    which time the scroll has already happened and no amount of

   *    suppressed at keydown, on the one press this capture has a claim to,

   *    its page-down replayed on release. Nothing is taken away — rule 1 keeps

  /**
   * The same hold, from a keyboard, while the BUTTON has focus.
   *
   * `onPointerDown` calls `preventDefault()`, so a tap never focuses the mic —
   * and without this the button was reachable by Tab and did nothing at all,
   * while its label promised "hold to dictate". The board-wide Space hotkey is
   * not the answer: it routes the utterance to the agent, not into the box the
   * mic sits in, and the quick-add mount opts out of it entirely.
   *
   * Why this cannot resurrect the singleton-gesture bug `spaceHotkey` exists
   * to prevent: that bug is TWO captures starting on ONE press, because
   * `document` hears every press regardless of where focus is. These handlers
   * are bound to a BUTTON, which belongs to exactly one capture — so a press
   * can only ever reach its own instance, at most twice (at the target, then
   * bubbling to that instance's own document listener). `beginHold` returns
   * early while already holding and `endHold` while not, so the second pass is
   * a no-op rather than a second recognizer. Asserted in voice-capture.test.ts
   * by counting `start()` calls for one press with both bound.
