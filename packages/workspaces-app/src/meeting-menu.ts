/**
 * The speaker menu: the popover Record opens while a meeting is running.
 * Split out of `meeting-strip.ts` (split-plan B4's follow-on), which keeps the
 * socket state machine the menu reports on. Its sibling is
 * `meeting-chooser.ts`, the popover the same button opens while nothing is
 * running — one panel element, two builders, and this is the running half.
 *
 * IT IS A REPORT WITH ONE VERB. Everything on it except Stop is a fact settled
 * before the meeting began — the source, how many voices were paid for, when
 * it started — because a streaming session's configuration IS its connect URL
 * and cannot move under it. The single exception is the Advanced Options
 * panel, borrowed back from the chooser: AssemblyAI's protocol takes some of
 * its turn-detection knobs on the open socket, and the panel says "next
 * recording" under every knob it does not.
 *
 * THE CAST OUTLIVES THE WINDOW. The rename rows list every voice the meeting
 * has shown, not the three turns still on the strip — a voice that spoke early
 * and went quiet has to stay nameable until the meeting is over, and after it
 * (the rename then rides HTTP to the meeting it belonged to). `speakerRow` is
 * this module's, and the chooser borrows it for the same reason: a doc opened
 * after its meeting ended shows its cast in the chooser, not here.
 *
 * IT OWNS NOTHING IT SHOWS. State, mode, cast, the live bot, the recording
 * engine and disposal all arrive as `MeetingMenuDeps` accessors, read at call
 * time because each is a `let` the strip moves; Stop and the popover's own
 * close are the strip's verbs, handed in.
