/**
 * The doc's meeting-bot lifecycle, headless — state in, verbs out, no DOM.
 *
 * This used to be `meeting-bot-row.ts`: a self-rendering row under the old
 * bottom strip with its own paste-a-link form. The top-bar overhaul moved
 * every meeting surface into one place (the Record button's strip, menu and
 * start chooser), so the form went there and what remains here is the part
 * that was never about pixels: one endpoint, one SSE event, and the rule that
 * a server without a Recall key has no bot feature at all.
 *
 * STILL DELIBERATELY NOT PART OF THE STRIP'S STATE MACHINE. The strip owns a
 * microphone, a permission prompt that can outlive the press, and a socket
 * that IS the meeting; a bot is none of those things and shares none of that
 * state. The chrome renders both; it does not merge them.
 *
 * WHAT IT CARRIES. The bot's STATE — joining, waiting to be let in, waiting
 * on the host's recording consent, recording, gone — and its WORDS: one
 * `meeting.transcript` per vendor frame, partials included, on the SAME
 * EventSource. Both ride the doc's existing event stream (no second socket
 * per tab for a bot that has no browser of its own); the words are transient
 * on the wire — never buffered, never given an id — so they cannot evict the
 * doc's real events from the replay window. See `MEETING_TRANSCRIPT_EVENT`
 * in core for the contract. The strip folds them through the same
 * `rollTranscript` the microphone's socket frames go through.
