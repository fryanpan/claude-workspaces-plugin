/**
 * The provisional zone: the live transcript rendered at the END of the doc,
 * where the notes it will become are about to land — instead of only in the
 * strip under the top bar, a viewport away from the writing.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. The transcript never enters the document — that invariant
 * belongs to the meeting pipeline (the notes agent writes the doc, from the
 * durable transcript, at pauses). This zone is chrome APPENDED AFTER the
 * editor's content element: plain DOM, no Yjs, gone without trace when the
 * meeting ends. Nothing here can leak a provisional word into the record.
 *
 * WHAT IT SHOWS: an unframed block, labelled "Live transcript" in its top
 * right corner, holding ONE flowing run of text. The engine hands words over
 * in turns of a few words every few seconds, and a turn is the engine's
 * unit, not the reader's (owner, 2026-09-01: "engine turns have no meaning
 * or value to the viewer, I expect a stream of text"). So turns are inline
 * spans joined by a space — no per-turn time stamp, no per-turn block — and
 * the only line breaks are the ones the engine itself put in a turn's text.
 * No status lights, no blinking dots; the one animated thing in the stream
 * is the caret on the words still being spoken.
 *
 * THE SETTLE (approved settle mock, round 2). When a tick fires the
 * settled words split off into a block of their own, so their height can be
 * collapsed later. That block carries no box, no label and no type change,
 * so its words land on the very pixels they were already on, and whatever is
 * still being said keeps streaming below it. When the note lands, those
 * words FADE WHERE THEY SIT — opacity alone, so not one word around them
 * moves — and only once they are gone does the slot collapse and ease the
 * stream up into the space. Two beats, never overlapping: the complaint was
 * drift, and every simultaneous movement is a source of it. The settle wash
 * on the freshly written note (settle-wash.ts) carries the eye upward.
 *
 * Nothing is drawn in the chunk's place while it composes — no card, no
 * "Writing this into the notes above…" line, no spinner. Both of those took
 * up space and shifted the words they wrapped (owner, 2026-09-05: "just fade
 * the text chunk out when it's written up into the text").
 *
 * Speaker pills follow the notes rule, not the strip's: only once a second
 * voice has actually been heard, and then only where the voice CHANGES — a
 * pill on every few words of one speaker is the engine's turn boundary
 * showing through again. A solo huddle's own name is noise (owner's call,
 * 2026-08-31). It reads through `speakerDisplayName`: a label carries a group.
