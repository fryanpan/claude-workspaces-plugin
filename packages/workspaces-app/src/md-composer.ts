/**
 * Every composer is a markdown editor (approved design, review-flow-mock-v1,
 * design point 4) — and "a markdown editor" means the surface the task
 * description already is: you type `**bold**` and the words go bold, `- ` and
 * a bullet appears. Not a box with a cheat sheet over it and a rendering of
 * itself underneath, which is what shipped first and what Bryan rejected:
 * *"the reply and comment inputs should be markdown editors like the task
 * description"*.
 *
 * The editor is the same Tiptap stack the description uses, minus the Yjs
 * room — a composer's words are private until they are posted, so there is
 * nothing to collaborate on and no document to bind to.
 *
 * THE TEXTAREA STAYS. It is hidden once the editor mounts, but it remains the
 * field the caller wired up: `.value` is the markdown, `.disabled` still
 * disables, `data-keep` still marks a draft to carry across a repaint, and
 * `input` still fires as you type. That is what lets five composers — the
 * doc's new-comment box, a thread reply, the task discussion, the walkthrough
 * answer and the Tell-me-more ask — become editors without any of them
 * changing how they send.
 *
 * Loading is lazy, for the reason the description editor is lazy: the hub
 * bundle is a board, and the whole Tiptap/ProseMirror stack measured 22× the
 * board's entry. Until the chunk lands (or if it never does) the plain
 * textarea is on screen and works.
