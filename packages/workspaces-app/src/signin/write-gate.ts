/**
 * What a refused write looks like to the person who made it.
 *
 * The server refuses an unsigned browser write with 401 and
 * `{"error":"sign_in_required"}` (server/src/middleware/write-gate.ts). On its
 * own that is invisible: this app has no shared fetch wrapper, and its
 * twenty-odd write call sites variously throw into a `catch` that shows
 * "Failed — try again", return `false`, or ignore the response entirely. A
 * person whose comment was refused for want of a session would have been told
 * to try again, and trying again would have failed the same way forever.
 *
 * Two halves, and both are needed.
 *
 * **Before** — `fetchWriteAccess` asks the server whether this browser may
 * write, ONCE, before the router starts, and the answer travels to every
 * surface on `MountContext.canWrite` so each one mounts already knowing. This
 * is the half that matters for prose: doc text goes over the yjs socket,
 * which the server holds open in read-only mode so reading is unaffected, and
 * a person allowed to type into a socket that drops every keystroke has been
 * told nothing at all — the text appears, syncs to nobody, and is gone on
 * reload.
 *
 * It is a value passed down rather than a call each surface makes, and that
 * is the whole lesson of the second review pass: a surface that asks for
 * itself is EDITABLE WHILE IT ASKS. There used to be an `applyWriteAccess()`
 * here that did exactly that, and the doc mount awaited it after it had
 * already gone live.
 *
 * **After** — `installWriteGateNotice` wraps `fetch` once and turns any
 * `sign_in_required` refusal into a prompt. One wrapper rather than an edit
 * at each call site, because the question this gate has to answer is "how do
 * you know you covered every write", and a list of call sites is a list that
 * silently stops being complete. It only ever reads the body of a 401 and
 * never changes what the caller receives, so every existing error path still
 * runs exactly as it did.
