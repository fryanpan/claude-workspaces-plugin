/**
 * Opening a thread from the keyboard.
 *
 * The whole card is the tap target, and a tap is not a gesture a keyboard has.
 * What carries the keyboard is `.thread-caret` — a real `<button>` in the head
 * row, outside both slots, so it is reachable while the detail face is `inert`.
 * A field review read the collapsed card as having no keyboard path at all;
 * the first three cases here are the regression guards that say otherwise, and
 * they are the reason the fix below is a NAME rather than a second tab stop.
 *
 * The genuine gap the same review pointed at: every caret on every card
 * announced the identical "Toggle comment thread". A sighted reader tells the
 * cards apart by the name and the flag; a keyboard or screen-reader user
 * arrives at a column of identical buttons and cannot tell which thread they
 * are on, or which one is holding a decision.
