/**
 * The activity log loads only when something reads it.
 *
 * The log is ~1000 rows (~590KB decompressed on the live board) and only two
 * surfaces read it: the Activity view and an open detail panel. It used to be
 * fetched unconditionally at boot AND re-fetched on every SSE task event —
 * dead weight on exactly the load Bryan measured at 10+ seconds on his iPad.
 *
 * DRIVEN, NOT GREPPED. This file used to read the seventeen board boot modules
 * as one string and match `if (!eventsConsumerActive()) return;` and
 * `void loadEvents();` against it. Two of the three cases were absences, and
 * an absence in source text is the weakest evidence there is: a regex for the
 * exact boot sequence that used to contain the call goes green the moment the
 * sequence is reformatted, reordered or moved to another module, whether or
 * not the fetch came back. What is actually in question is whether a request
 * for `/events` leaves the page — so boot the board and read the fetch log.
