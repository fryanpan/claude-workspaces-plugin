/**
 * The goal header's effort readout — the board half of the effort model.
 *
 * Three things are worth a test here and nothing else is:
 *
 *  1. **The rollup does not depend on who is looking.** `taskVisible` hides
 *     done rows outside the reader's done-window and, on the "Mine" tab,
 *     every row that is not theirs. Computing the percentage off what
 *     survives that would make a goal's progress a function of the current
 *     filter — switching tabs would swing it without a ticket moving.
 *  2. **Three states reach the screen as three states.** Never scored, an
 *     attempt that failed, and a real 0% are different sentences, and the
 *     easiest bug in this whole feature is rendering the first two as the
 *     third.
 *  3. **The task rows stay clean.** "No need to show hands on or wall clock
 *     hours in the board" (Bryan, 2026-08-30) — the numbers belong on the
 *     ticket, and a row must not sprout one.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic.
