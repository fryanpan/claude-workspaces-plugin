/**
 * The board as a Preact island — the goal bands and the task rows that
 * `renderBoard` used to empty its container and rebuild on every paint.
 *
 * Three families of properties under test:
 *
 *  1. The island contract: an unchanged row survives a signal update as the
 *     IDENTICAL node object, disposal is render(null, el), and the island owns
 *     a wrapper rather than the host. The identity assertion carries its own
 *     positive control — the same comparison against a deliberately unkeyed
 *     list, which DOES rebuild — because a `toBe` that cannot fail proves
 *     nothing. (Measured against the vanilla `renderBoard` before it was
 *     deleted: it failed there, on every row, on every update.)
 *
 *  2. The defects the migration exists for, in the form they take HERE. A
 *     board repaint used to destroy an in-flight rename, drop the focus a
 *     keyboard reorder depends on, and close the "New goal" box over what had
 *     been typed into it — the last of which is the two-tap report: the first
 *     tap opened the box, a background event closed it again, and the reader
 *     tapped a second time.
 *
 *  3. Behaviour parity with the vanilla renderer: rows, bands, badges,
 *     pickers, the caret, inline renaming, drag and keyboard reordering. These
 *     are the renderBoard tests from board-render.test.ts, re-aimed at the
 *     island and otherwise unchanged.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic — invented names, jordan@partner.example register.
