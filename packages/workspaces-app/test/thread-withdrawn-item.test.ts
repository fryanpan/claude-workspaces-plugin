/**
 * How a WITHDRAWN review item reads in the doc's thread pane.
 *
 * This is the only surface a retracted ask appears on at all — the queue drops
 * it and `pendingDeclaration` steps over it — so if it renders here as an
 * ordinary question, the reader answers a question nobody is asking. That is
 * the exact failure the verb exists to prevent: the words stay because
 * somebody may already have read them, and the marking is what turns them
 * from a live ask into history.
 *
 * The other half is the fallback card. A thread's item card falls back to the
 * newest declaration when nothing is pending, and a withdrawn one must not be
 * it — otherwise the card shows a retracted ask while the queue offers a live
 * one from the same thread.
