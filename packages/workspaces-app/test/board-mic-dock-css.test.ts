/**
 * The hold-to-talk mic is DOCKED in the workspace nav, not floating over the
 * page.
 *
 * Bryan, 2026-08-19: *"can we make a more durable fix for the mic? Place it in
 * a fixed location instead of floating. Put it in bottom left of left navbar in
 * desktop views. And in the bottom tab on mobile, and give it a distinct look
 * and keep it slightly separate from the navbar so it's clear it's not a
 * navbar item"*.
 *
 * The float is the bug. A `position: fixed` launcher in the bottom-left corner
 * lands on top of whatever the page happens to put there — at 430px it sat on
 * "Record answer", the one control the review queue exists to deliver. This
 * branch answered that twice by reserving space around the mic (152fb3f,
 * 50c9619); a reservation is a promise that nothing will ever be positioned
 * under one particular column, and it has to be renewed at every width where
 * the promise could be broken. Docking the mic makes the promise unnecessary:
 * the mic lives in the nav's own column and no page content is ever behind it.
 *
 * The rail, the 901–1100px strip and the phone's bottom bar are three
 * different layouts of the same element, and every claim below is a claim
 * about ONE of them. That is what the old text version of this file could not
 * express: it regexed `styles.css` and `board.css` for declarations and then
 * reasoned about which `@media` block they had been found inside, which
 * passes whether or not the query matches at the width a reader is on. Here
 * the nav is built at 1180, at 1000 and at 430 and the computed value is read,
 * so the tier boundaries are measured rather than argued.
 *
 * The MARKUP half still reads `board-app.ts`: where the mic sits in the nav's
 * child order is a fact about the file that renders it. What a browser still
 * has to confirm is in the PR body: how the docked control READS.
