/**
 * Home carries no board rows.
 *
 * The board column is `display: none` on Home (`.board-main--home .board-col`),
 * and until this test existed the render path ran there anyway: `setNav`
 * called `renderBoardRegion()` for every destination, so arriving at Home
 * built one `.board-task-row` per task — 70 of them on the real board, measured
 * headless at 430x932 and 1180x820 — each with its selects and its drag and
 * keyboard listeners, and then collapsed the lot to zero height.
 *
 * Zero-height rows are not merely waste. They answer DOM queries, so anything
 * that reads the board by selector gets a full row set on a page showing
 * none, and `document.scrollHeight` on Home reported 998px against a 932px
 * viewport — a scroll probe that looks like it ran and saw nothing.
 *
 * The comment that used to justify the hiding said the board "keeps its
 * realtime projection warm underneath". The projection is `state.tasks`, fed
 * by the ydoc; the rows are derived output rebuilt from it in one pass. So the
 * fix is to stop rendering them, and the round-trip case below is what proves
 * the unmount is not one-way.
 *
 * All fixtures are synthetic.

 * started this ticket was a DOM query (70 zero-height `.board-task-row` nodes
 * answering selectors on a page showing none), so make the same query.
