/**
 * A board's worth of state and DOM, for the region modules that used to be
 * `board-app.ts`'s render closure.
 *
 * Each region is now a factory over `BoardState` plus one explicit dependency
 * object, so a suite can build the region alone. What it still needs is the
 * two things the closure used to supply for free: a `BoardState` with every
 * field set, and the shell's containers — so both are here rather than
 * re-typed in a dozen files.
 *
 * `buildShell` paints the real markup, so `el('board-home-review')` in a test
 * resolves to the same node it resolves to on the page. Nothing here fakes a
 * render.
