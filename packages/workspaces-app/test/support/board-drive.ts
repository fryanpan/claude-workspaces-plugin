/**
 * One board boot, driven, for the suites that used to read the boot's source.
 *
 * `board-boot.test.ts`, `lazy-events.test.ts` and `load-beacon.test.ts` each
 * grew their own copy of the same forty lines — install the fakes, answer the
 * five routes every boot asks for, build the env, seed the ydoc, settle. The
 * suites converted off source-text reads need exactly that and nothing new, so
 * it lives here once.
 *
 * Not a second implementation of the boot: everything below is the same
 * `boot-harness.ts` fakes, assembled. What is under test is always the real
 * `bootBoard`.
 *
 * The fake fetch dispatcher is installed at MODULE load, because
 * `installWriteGateNotice` wraps `window.fetch` once per process and binds
 * whatever it finds — see `installFakeServer`. Vitest isolates a module
 * registry per test file, so one install per file is what happens.

 *
 *  - **Drag to reorder a row** (`board-island.tsx` `onHandleDown`). The drop
 *    target comes from `document.elementFromPoint` and `getBoundingClientRect`
 *    on the rows under the finger, and happy-dom lays nothing out: every rect
 *    is zero and there is no element at any point. The ACTION is still
 *    reachable — Alt+Arrow on the row and the arrow keys on the focused handle
 *    run the same `onReorder`, and `dropIndexFor` is a pure function with its
 *    own tests in `board-model.test.ts` — so what is untestable here is the
 *    drag, not the reordering.
 *  - **Comment on a selection** (`selection-pill.ts`, `review-item-phrase.ts`,
 *    and the `getSelection` reads in the task-detail, home-activity and
 *    walkthrough islands). It needs a live `Selection` over rendered text;
 *    the suites that touch it stub `document.getSelection` instead (see the

/**
 * Press and hold something the boot built, long enough to arm a long-press.
 *
 * The board's one long-press is the presence circle's follow, and it is a
 * `pointerdown` that arms a `setTimeout` and any of `pointerup` /
 * `pointercancel` / `pointerleave` that disarms it (`presence-island.tsx`).
 * So the gesture is a real event sequence over a real clock, and the only
 * part a driver has to fake is the wait: `settle` turns the microtask queue
 * and `holdMs` is a threshold, not a duration to sleep through. Vitest's fake
 * clock is what lets the press be held for 550ms without the suite taking
 * 550ms — and only around the hold, so the boot's own intervals (the 30s
 * presence tick, the home clock) keep running on the real one.
 *
 * `holdMs` defaults past the board's own threshold, imported rather than
 * copied; pass a shorter one to drive a press that is released too early,
 * which is the control for any test asserting the long-press did something.
 *
 * The release goes to the element AND to `board.window`, because the fake env
 * splits the two: `document` is a real DOM the press bubbles through, but the
 * boot's `window` is a bare EventTarget, and the repaint guard listens for the
 * release there (`createRepaintGuard({ dom: document, win: window })`). In a
 * browser one `pointerup` reaches both. Skipping the window copy leaves the
 * guard armed and parks every background repaint until its 10s watchdog.
