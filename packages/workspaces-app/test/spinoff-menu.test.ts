/**
 * The spin-off verbs (src/spinoff-menu.ts) — the two ways a line of a huddle
 * doc leaves the doc as work.
 *
 * `runSpinoff` is the verb chain and is driven entirely through an injected
 * fetch, so no server runs here. NOTHING IN THE UI CALLS IT as of 2026-09-04:
 * the pill that offered Research and Create Task offers only Comment now, and
 * the ask is made in the comment. The verbs and their routes were not
 * withdrawn, so they are still driven here — a later ticket decides whether
 * they come back behind something else.
 *
 * The branch that decides a huddle doc gets the pill at all lives in the
 * per-doc markdown mount in `app.ts`, which the boot suite does not reach:
 * `bootApp` is driveable, but `mountMarkdown` runs per doc rather than per
 * page. It is verified in a browser at 1180×820 and 430px instead, and
 * reported with the PR.
 *
 * Fixtures are synthetic (jordan@partner.example register).
