/**
 * "No open comments" is an ABSENCE presented as a FACT, and the panel is
 * handed `[]` before the websocket has delivered anything — so an unsynced
 * doc and a genuinely empty one rendered the identical sentence. On a doc
 * somebody plans their week in, that sentence reads as data loss.
 *
 * The gate is deliberately ONE-DIRECTIONAL: `synced` starts false and only
 * ever moves to true, so its failure mode is a doc that keeps saying
 * "Loading comments…" a little too long, never one that claims emptiness it
 * cannot know. Every assertion below has its positive control in the same
 * file — an absence test that never showed the message CAN render would be
 * vacuous.
