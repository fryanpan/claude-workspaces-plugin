/**
 * Pressing Comment on the pointer pill: what the reader gets, on the wiring
 * `app.ts` actually builds.
 *
 * Bryan's acceptance criteria, verbatim (2026-09-04): *"when user clicks
 * comment, focus immediately on the text input and suggest in placeholder
 * text that they can request research, ask for edits, or ask to create
 * task(s)"*. Two claims, and neither can be checked on either half alone —
 * `doc-pointer-pill.test.ts` hands the pill a spy for a composer, and the
 * composer suites open the composer by calling it. So this file wires the
 * real layer to the real chrome, exactly the way the markdown mount does,
 * and presses the button.
 *
 * IMMEDIATELY means in the click's own tick. The caret used to be scheduled
 * 30ms out, and iOS raises the keyboard only for a focus that happens inside
 * the gesture that asked for it — so those 30ms cost the reader a second tap
 * on the device this pill is mostly used from. The focus tests run under fake
 * timers and NEVER advance them: anything that came back as a timer would read
 * here as no focus at all.
 *
 * The caret lands on one of two surfaces, and both are driven. Until the
 * editor chunk arrives the textarea IS the box, and the focus is plainly
 * synchronous. Once the editor is live the focus goes through Tiptap, which
 * calls `view.dom.focus()` synchronously for iOS, iPadOS and desktop Safari
 * and defers only the ProseMirror-level selection into a frame
 * (`@tiptap/core`, `src/commands/focus.ts`) — so the live-editor test states
 * an iPad's user agent, and fails without it, which is the control for a test
 * that would otherwise be asserting happy-dom's defaults.
 *
 * What none of this reaches is the keyboard itself: no headless browser is an
 * iPad. That half is Bryan's, and the browser check reported with the PR only
 * shows the composer open with its input focused.
 *
 * The shell is the shipped one, read as the fixture it is: the placeholder
 * this asserts on is an attribute in `index.html`, and a hand-written copy of
 * the composer markup would assert the copy.
