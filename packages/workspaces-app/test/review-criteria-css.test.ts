/**
 * The criteria field and the held note's foot — the two boxes added after the
 * UX review, at the two sizes this project checks.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT PROVE. happy-dom does no layout, so nothing here
 * measures a rendered pixel. What it does run is the cascade, so every rule
 * below is read as the value the browser would USE rather than as a string
 * that survives in the file — which is the difference that matters for the
 * two boxes' caps and floors, all of which are overridable from a later rule
 * a text search cannot see. What is guarded is the handful of declarations
 * that, if lost, break exactly the two viewports in the project's convention
 * — 1180x820 (iPad landscape, where HEIGHT is the scarce axis, ~750px usable)
 * and 430px (phone, where width is).
 *
 * One thing the text version asserted is gone and is named where it was: the
 * override's `:hover` / `:focus-visible` / `:active` inversion, which has no
 * pointer to enter it. That one is a `bun run ui:shot` check. The panel's own
 * `width: min(560px, 100%)` is gone for a different reason — the popover it
 * belonged to is a page now, and the column's `max-width` holds the measure.
