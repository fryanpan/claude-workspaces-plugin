# Learnings

Technical discoveries that should persist across sessions for this project.

## An MCP source fix doesn't reach peers until the tracked bundle is rebuilt

- **PR #69 declared the `groups` param in `create_diff_review`'s inputSchema
  (`packages/mcp/src/mcp.ts`) but never rebuilt `packages/plugin/mcp/index.js`
  — so no peer ever got the fix.** Peers load the MCP server via
  `.mcp.json` → `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/mcp/index.js`, i.e. the
  **tracked, committed bundle**, NOT the TypeScript source. That bundle is
  regenerated only by `bun run build:mcp` (which writes both
  `packages/mcp/dist/mcp.js` and `packages/plugin/mcp/index.js`). Editing
  `mcp.ts` and merging changes nothing peers can see; the bundle on `main`
  was last rebuilt two PRs earlier (#59) and still lacked `groups`. The
  "peer picks it up on next session restart" reasoning was doubly wrong — a
  restart reloads the *stale committed bundle*, so even restarting didn't
  help.
- **Rule: any PR that touches `packages/mcp/src/**` MUST run
  `bun run build:mcp` and commit the regenerated
  `packages/plugin/mcp/index.js` in the same PR.** `packages/mcp/dist/` is
  gitignored (not shipped); `packages/plugin/mcp/index.js` is the shipped
  artifact and IS tracked — verify it's in `git status` before pushing.
  Grep the diff for the schema/description change in `index.js`, not just in
  `mcp.ts`. Same class as "the route layer silently drops params": the fix
  lived one layer away from where it's consumed.
- The two client bundles differ in how they ship: `markdown-app/dist` is
  **untracked** and rebuilt at deploy time on the server (served
  per-request), so a markdown-app change is rebuild-on-the-box; the MCP
  bundle is **tracked** and travels through git to each peer's plugin cache,
  so it must be committed. Don't conflate them.

## Yjs attribute TYPES reach prosemirror untouched — a string ≠ a number

- **Every heading parsed from markdown rendered as `<h1>` because we stored
  `level` as `String(level)`.** Tiptap's Heading picks its tag with
  `this.options.levels.includes(node.attrs.level)` against the NUMBERS
  `[1..6]`, and y-prosemirror passes Yjs attributes through to
  `schema.node(name, attrs)` verbatim — no coercion. `'2'` fails the
  `includes` check, so the node falls back to `levels[0]` = `h1` and H1/H2/H3
  all render the same size. It looked like a *reparse* bug (reparse re-seeds
  from disk, so it re-introduced the string) and it "fixed itself" when a
  human re-set the heading in the toolbar — because prosemirror writes the
  NUMBER back. Rule: when a Yjs attribute feeds a prosemirror node attr,
  match the type the extension expects exactly; every reader here already did
  `Number(...)`, which is exactly why the bug hid for so long.
- **Yjs stores any JSON value in an attribute; only its TS types insist on
  strings** (`Y.XmlElement<KV>` defaults `KV` to `{[k:string]: string}`).
  Type the element as `Y.XmlElement<{ level: number }>` rather than casting
  the value.
- **Legacy state needs a migration, not just a writer fix.** Docs already
  persisted in `.ydoc` keep the string; `normalizeHeadingLevels(doc)` runs on
  room load so existing docs repair themselves without a reparse.
- **Verify at the layer the bug lives in.** The block model and the
  `/content` API were CORRECT the whole time — only the rendered editor was
  wrong. The test that proves the fix builds a real Tiptap editor over the
  Yjs doc (`Collaboration.configure({document: ydoc})`, no provider needed)
  and asserts `editor.getHTML()` contains `<h2>`. Reverting the writer to
  `String(level)` makes it fail — an assertion on the Yjs attribute alone
  would not have.

## A destructive re-seed orphans threads it never needed to touch

- **`fragment.delete(0, len) + push(freshBlocks)` (the old reparse/reconcile
  apply path) destroys the `Y.XmlText` identity of EVERY block**, so every
  thread anchor in the doc breaks — including threads on paragraphs the
  rewrite never touched. `applyMarkdownToFragment` diffs at block granularity
  (LCS over each block's serialized markdown) and only replaces the blocks
  that actually changed, so untouched blocks keep their identity and their
  RelativePositions keep resolving. The snippet-match `autoReanchorDoc` sweep
  stays as the backstop for anchors *inside* a rewritten block.
- **A prelim (not-yet-integrated) `Y.XmlElement` has no readable children** —
  `toArray()` walks `_start`, which is null until the type belongs to a doc.
  Serializing freshly-parsed blocks to key them therefore returns empty
  strings. Integrate a throwaway copy in a scratch `Y.Doc` to read them (and
  parse a second time for the blocks you actually insert — an integrated Yjs
  type cannot be re-parented).

## Don't let the editor tools write raw control bytes into source

- A NUL byte landed in `prose.ts` from a sentinel string I meant to write as
  a leading space (`` `\x00unserializable` ``), which turns the file "binary"
  to grep and would have failed review. Same class as the biome
  `noControlCharactersInRegex` trip earlier. Use plain ASCII sentinels
  (`__unserializable_block_${i}__`); if grep starts reporting "Binary file
  matches" on a source file you just edited, that's what happened.

## The route layer silently drops params unit tests can't see

- **Every REST handler in server.ts hand-copies body fields into the rooms
  call — a new param needs THREE additions (MCP tool, route, rooms), and
  the route is the one nothing type-checks.** `groups` was added to the MCP
  tool schema and to `bindDiff`, but not forwarded by `POST /api/diffs`:
  the API accepted it, returned ok:true, and discarded it. Unit tests
  passed (they call `bindDiff` directly); the outside agent reported
  success TWICE (it trusted the 200). Only probing the live server's
  resulting state exposed it. Rules: (1) when adding a param to a rooms
  method, grep the route that fronts it in the same change; (2) write at
  least one HTTP-level test through the real route per new param; (3) a
  peer agent's "it worked" means "the call didn't error" — verify the
  server-side EFFECT before believing a success report (same lesson as
  diagnose-before-recommending, inverted).
- **Related: don't let your own maintenance operations clobber
  caller-supplied state.** A group-less refresh re-bind overwrote
  agent-supplied groups with the heuristic because "refresh derived
  fields" treated groups as derived. Fields that are sometimes derived and
  sometimes caller-authored need an explicit precedence rule (explicit
  wins; refresh only fills gaps).

## A negative test needs a positive control or it proves nothing

- **A probe that asserts "the secret isn't there" is worthless until you've
  shown the probe can see anything at all.** Checking whether `/y/<docId>`
  leaks doc metadata to a share visitor, a raw `WebSocket` reported clean on
  every field — because a raw socket never completes the Yjs sync handshake.
  20 bytes arrived and the doc's own text never did, so every "false" was
  vacuous. Adding one line (`WS has doc text?`) flipped the result: the
  leak was real and total. Reuse the repo's own client (`connectDoc` in
  `packages/server/test/ws.test.ts`: `lib0/encoding`, `lib0/decoding`,
  `y-protocols/sync`) rather than hand-rolling a protocol client.
- Same failure mode caught twice more in one session: a traversal test with
  `expect()` inside a `try` whose `catch` swallowed the failure (a test that
  could never fail — the escape genuinely leaked), and two "the fix changed
  the ordering" tests that passed by alphabetical accident. **Rule: every
  test whose assertion is an absence must first assert a presence** — the
  socket synced, the stream delivered an event while access was live, the
  owner's copy still has the field. Then prove non-vacuity by breaking the
  fix and watching it fail.

## Anything in the Yjs doc is readable by every peer, including share visitors

- **Redacting a REST payload closes one door out of two.** `DocMeta`'s
  `sourceUrl` / `owner` / `workspaceRoot` / `producedBy` describe the host
  machine, and `redactMetaForVisitor` stripped them from
  `GET /api/docs/<id>` — but they also lived in the ydoc `meta` map, and Yjs
  sync is a **state exchange, not a per-connection projection**. There is no
  supported way to withhold part of a doc from one peer, so a field that
  must not reach a visitor cannot live in the CRDT at all. Those four keys
  now live in a `<docId>.private.json` sidecar
  (`packages/server/src/private-meta.ts`).
- **Check who actually READS a value before assuming it has to be synced.**
  All four were server-only; the one client reader (`code-app.ts`'s
  syntax-highlighting fallback) already preferred the REST payload. The
  client only *observed* the meta map as a change signal.
- Two things the move needed that are easy to miss: (1) the sidecar rides
  the SAME debounced write as the `.ydoc` (`saveToDisk`), because two
  persistence paths drift and a doc that loses its `sourceUrl` stops
  writing back to disk **silently**; (2) every already-persisted `.ydoc`
  carries the keys, so loading a room must LIFT them out — reading alone
  leaves them in the state the next visitor syncs — and force a snapshot,
  since the lift's transaction runs before `wireEvents` is listening.
- **A long-lived grant needs a revocation path per transport.** Websockets
  were covered; SSE (`/events/<docId>`) was not, and Access-mode shares
  never enforced their TTL at all (`findByHostname` ignores `expiresAt`
  where link mode's `findLive` doesn't). When auditing "what can a revoked
  visitor still reach", enumerate every connection that is authorized ONCE
  at open, not per request.

## Diff review (type='diff') — immutable content changes the rules

- **A diff review is "bind_folder where the file list comes from `git diff`
  and the bytes come from `git show target:path`".** One doc per changed
  file grouped under workspaceId = reviewId buys the tree UI, thread stack,
  SSE watch, delete_workspace, and cleanup for free. Content pinned to a
  commit hash needs NO mtime poll, NO write-back, and anchors can never
  drift — most of the sync machinery is deliberately not wired.
- **@codemirror/merge's `collapseUnchanged` computes its ranges ONLY at
  StateField init** (`CollapsedRanges.init(buildCollapsedRanges)`); the
  update path only ever removes ranges. Our editors mount before the Yjs
  websocket delivers content, so the field initialized over an empty doc
  and nothing ever collapsed. Fix: re-init the merge compartment
  (`Compartment.reconfigure` with fresh extensions) on the first real
  content change. General rule: any CM extension that derives state via
  `Field.init(...)` is stale for docs that stream in after mount.
- **Viewport-virtualized DOM lies to counting queries.** `querySelectorAll
  ('.cm-changedLine').length === 0` at scroll-top proved nothing — CM only
  renders the viewport. Scroll to the region (or use state, not DOM) before
  concluding a decoration is missing. Also: match deletion widgets to
  chunks by `view.posAtDOM(widget)`, never by DOM order — off-viewport
  widgets aren't in the DOM at all.
- **`createThreadByFind` resolved only against the prose fragment**, so
  agent-side `create_thread` returned no-match on every code/diff doc
  (empty fragment) — a gap dating from the code surface (PR #55). Flat
  content docs need their own find path against `content.toString()` with
  line-snapped anchors. When a doc kind stores content in a different Yjs
  surface, grep every `prose.*(ydoc)` call site for the missing branch.
- **Old/new dual line numbers**: new = `lineNumbers()`; old = a custom
  gutter mapping posB→posA by accumulating chunk size deltas (pure,
  unit-tested `oldLineForPos`); deleted lines live inside widget DOM where
  no gutter reaches — stamp `data-old-line` on `.cm-deletedLine` divs and
  render via CSS `::before content: attr(...)`. Gutter ORDER follows
  extension order: the old-number gutter must precede `lineNumbers()` in
  the same extension list to render on the left.

## A unit test can be true and still prove nothing about the caller

- **`isWhitespaceOnlyChange('a b', 'ab') === false` passed from the first
  commit, and the feature still hid a real code change.** Nothing ever
  called the function with whole strings: `presentableDiff` reports
  `foo bar` → `foobar` as a change whose two slices are exactly `' '` and
  `''`, and both squash to empty. The classifier said "whitespace", the
  filter suppressed it, and the line vanished from the diff entirely with
  the default-on toggle. The assertion was TRUE and USELESS — it tested an
  input shape production never produces. Rule: when a predicate is applied
  to *slices of* something, test it through the thing that slices, not on
  hand-written whole values. The fix classifies the enclosing LINES.
- **Three adversarial rounds each found a distinct real defect**, all of
  the same family (whitespace-insensitive diffing is lossy) but at
  different layers: slice-vs-line, whitespace inside a string literal
  (`"a  b"` → `"a b"` changes what the program prints), and
  indentation-significant languages (reindenting a Python statement moves
  it into an `if` block). `git diff -w` and every hide-whitespace view
  built on it get the last two wrong. Guards: classify on lines; skip
  changes starting inside a quoted span; default the whole feature OFF for
  `.py`/`.yaml`/`Makefile`-class files. Each guard is deliberately
  ONE-DIRECTIONAL — it can only keep MORE visible, so its failure mode is
  noise rather than a hidden change.
- **Don't stop at the first clean-looking review.** Rounds 2 and 3 only
  existed because round 1's fix was non-trivial. Conversely, know when to
  stop: round 4 would restate the inherent limitation, which is now
  handled where it actually bites and documented where it doesn't.

## Suppressing a diff chunk silently breaks anything that counts chunks

- **`oldLineForPos` reconstructs base line numbers by accumulating the size
  delta of every chunk before a position** — so a change the whitespace
  filter drops contributes no delta, and every old line number after a
  reindent is wrong by the width of the indent. Silently: the gutter keeps
  rendering plausible numbers. Suppressed changes must be RECORDED and fed
  back into the mapping, not discarded.
- Three distinct cases, only found by checking every line of a realistic
  fixture against the base text: (1) reindent — same line count, maps 1:1;
  (2) blank line added — line counts differ, so NO base number (repeating
  the line above asserts an identity that doesn't exist); (3) the line
  *after* an insertion — maps into the MIDDLE of a base line, which is the
  tell that it has no counterpart. Guard: only claim a base line when the
  mapped position IS that line's start.
- **The test that caught (2) and (3) asserts a relationship, not values**:
  for every line, if the gutter shows a number, the base line at that
  number must be the same line of code. Per-line expected-value assertions
  would have been written to match the buggy output.
- `hidden` regions are read once per VISIBLE LINE by the gutter, so
  rebuilding + sorting the merged region list there is a per-frame cliff on
  a large reformatted file. Memoized on the source arrays by identity —
  which only works because the filter REPLACES the array each recompute
  instead of mutating it in place. Mutating a cache key is a trap.

## Concurrent agent+human edits are CRDT-safe; disk reconcile was not

- **Agent edits don't clobber a live human editor — the in-memory path is
  already safe.** Every agent edit tool (`findAndReplace`, `rewriteRange`,
  `insertAfterRange`, `insertBlocksAfterAnchor`) runs as a targeted Yjs
  transaction on the SAME `room.ydoc` the browser syncs to over the
  websocket. Concurrent agent + browser edits therefore CRDT-merge, they
  don't overwrite. A peer reported "agent find_and_replace clobbered my
  edits"; reproduced the scenario in `ws.test.ts` and it does NOT clobber.
  Don't reach for a lock/reject scheme — it would fight the real-time
  co-editing goal. The reported loss was actually the serializer bug below.
- **The real clobber vector was `reconcileFromDisk`'s destructive
  delete-all+push.** When the bound file changed on disk AND the live doc
  had its own un-flushed edits, the old reconcile blindly replaced the
  whole fragment with disk content, discarding the human's in-progress
  work. Fix (PR for the two-bug report): a pure, unit-tested
  `decideReconcile(disk, lastWritten, currentSerialized)` returning
  `in-sync | catch-up | apply | conflict`. On `conflict` keep the live
  edits (editor = runtime source of truth), reassert them to disk via the
  debounced writer, and record a `syncError` (recoverable with
  `reparse_from_disk`). General rule: a destructive `fragment.delete(0,len)
  + push` from an external source must first check whether the live doc
  diverged since the last write — if it did, that's a conflict, not a
  one-way apply.
- **mtime-poll detection misses same-mtime writes — don't write a test that
  saves faster than the filesystem's mtime granularity.** The disk→doc poll
  detects changes by `statSync().mtimeMs`. Rapid back-to-back saves can land
  in the same mtime tick on a coarse temp filesystem, so the second write is
  invisible. A rename-survival test that did three saves with no spacing was
  ~50% flaky (failed at the 2nd save) on BOTH the pre-change and changed
  trees — pre-existing, surfaced only because a single local run looked
  green. Fix: force a strictly-increasing mtime in the test (`utimesSync`);
  real editor saves are seconds apart so distinct mtimes are realistic. When
  a test fails intermittently, measure the baseline flakiness on unmodified
  HEAD (run it 5×) BEFORE assuming your change caused it.

## Serializer must recurse for nested lists (round-trip fidelity)

- **The markdown serializer flattened nested lists + multi-paragraph list
  items into one space-joined line, destroying structure on write-back.**
  `listItems()` did `textContent(child)` for EVERY child of a `listItem`
  joined by a space — but a `listItem` holds a paragraph PLUS optional
  nested `bulletList`/`orderedList` children and extra paragraphs (the
  y-prosemirror shape). A human's nested "Notes & Questions" section was
  irrecoverably flattened on the doc→disk→doc path. Fix: a recursive
  `serializeList(node, depth)` (2-space indent per level) + an
  indentation-stack parser (`parseListAt` / `consumeItemChildren`) so BOTH
  ends round-trip. Lesson: any serializer for a recursive document schema
  must itself recurse — a flat `textContent` join silently eats nesting,
  and the parser must read the same indentation convention back or the
  round-trip still loses data on the next reload.

## Stateful services + hydration

- Yjs state hydration ≠ binding hydration. Loading `.ydoc` files restores
  doc state but does not re-wire the `observeDeep` listener that schedules
  disk write-back. PR #28 fixed `hydrateFromDisk` to call `attachFile` for
  any markdown doc whose `sourceUrl` resolves on disk. Lesson: any time we
  add a state-hydration path, audit every listener that the live attach
  flow wires up — silent half-attached states are extremely hard to
  diagnose because reads keep working.

## fs.watch is the wrong primitive for disk→doc sync

- **A file-level `fs.watch` goes deaf after the first rename-based save.**
  `fs.watch(file)` is bound to the file's *inode* at watch-creation time
  (kqueue on macOS, inotify on Linux). Editors — and Claude Code's own
  `Edit` tool — save via write-temp-then-`rename`, which atomically
  replaces the inode. The watch fires one final event and then is
  permanently stale: only the FIRST external edit ever reaches the live
  doc. Deterministic, reproduced on both Bun and Node. This is the bug
  behind "I edited the bound .md and it stopped syncing" reports (PR #46).
- **The fixes that *look* right are platform-divergent.** Re-arming the
  watcher on the `rename` event works on macOS but still drops the 2nd
  save on Linux; watching the parent directory + filtering by basename
  works on macOS but proved unreliable under Bun-on-Linux. Don't trust a
  watcher fix that only passed on your Mac — Linux CI will catch it.
- **Resolution: poll the file's mtime instead** (PR #46 ships a 500ms
  `statSync().mtimeMs` poll, `unref()`'d so it never blocks process/test
  exit). Immune to inode swaps, platform, and runtime; ~1s latency matches
  the doc's sync contract. `scheduleFileWrite` stamps its own write's mtime
  so the write-back isn't mistaken for an external edit. General rule: if
  you need reliable cross-platform file-change detection, reach for an
  mtime poll, not `fs.watch`.
- **Recovery tool:** `reparse_from_disk(docId)` MCP tool force-pulls disk
  into the live doc in place (no URL re-bind). The server method/route had
  existed for a while but no MCP tool wrapped it — so docs referenced a
  tool that couldn't be called. When you add a server route meant for
  agents, add the MCP tool in the same change.

## find_and_replace gotchas

- Empties a containing block but doesn't remove it. If a replacement
  drains the only content of a blockquote / list item / paragraph, the
  block stays as an empty shell. Workarounds: use the block-deletion API
  (`delete_block_at_anchor` / `delete_blocks_in_range` / `delete_section`,
  added in PR #6) when you mean to remove a block, or do a clean
  serialization pass at the swap point. Tracked: backlog tasks for an
  inline auto-cleanup behavior.
- Can't split list items. `replace='item-a\n\nitem-b'` produces a paragraph
  break inside one list item, not a sibling item. Backlog: a dedicated
  `insert_list_item_after_text` or `insert_blocks_after_thread` extension.
- Can't add new inline marks by default. Replacement strings with `**bold**`
  / `*italic*` / `[link](url)` syntax land as literal characters unless you
  pass `parseInlineMarks: true`, which interprets them as marks.
- **It used to DELETE marks that were already there, silently — that half is
  fixed, and it was data loss rather than a missing feature.** Until the
  covering-marks fix, the replacement was re-inserted with NO attributes, and
  Yjs' unattributed `insert` inherits the marks of the character to the LEFT
  of the insertion point. So a match starting strictly inside a bold run kept
  its bold (which is why most replaces looked fine), while a match starting at
  the run's FIRST character inherited the unmarked text in front of it — and
  when the match covered the whole run (a bold label, a link, an inline-code
  span) the mark disappeared from the document with `ok: true` and nothing
  else to see. Found in the field on two list labels whose siblings kept their
  bold, caught only because someone counted `**` markers before and after.
  **The one-sentence trigger: the replacement inherited from the left instead
  of from the text it replaced, so any match beginning at a marked run's first
  character lost that run's marks.**
- Both edit paths now read the marks off the text being REPLACED
  (`coveringInlineMarks`), which is what the suggestion path always did — so
  before the fix, `suggest: true` + accept PRESERVED the bold that the plain
  call destroyed. When two paths are supposed to produce the same state, test
  them against each other; the disagreement is the bug report.
- **Marks covering only PART of a match still cannot be carried** — one
  replacement string has no correspondence to the runs it replaces — so those
  come back as `marksDropped: ['bold']` plus a `warning` on the 200 response.
  That is the actual fix: the loss that remains is the loss that gets
  reported. Widening the match to include an unmarked character is also how
  you deliberately REMOVE a mark.
- Backlog: a dedicated `apply_mark` tool.

## A "we're working on it" UI state must be grounded in the work, not inferred

- **A pending/loading state the client INFERS will lie, and the lie is
  always in the direction of promising something that never arrives.** The
  first cut of "Generating summary…" inferred in-flight generation from
  three client-visible facts (a doc-wide `summariesEnabled` flag + stale
  stored summary + recent `lastActivity`). Every one of those was true in
  cases where NO generation was queued: share-visitor writes are gated
  (`generate: !visitor`, so `scheduleSummary` is never reached), and thread
  CREATION queues a call whose result can only change the topic — the
  no-replies discussion line is deterministic by design, so the card
  promised a sentence, waited 5s, and fell back to "No replies yet". Fix:
  the server writes `summaryPendingTs` into the thread's Yjs map at the
  exact point it QUEUES the call, and the client reads that. **Grain
  matters: "this server does X" is not "X is happening for this item".**
- **Time-bound the marker, and treat expiry as a clock event.** The window
  is what turns a failed API call back into the deterministic lines instead
  of a spinner nobody clears. But nothing in the ydoc changes at expiry, so
  no observer fires — the card needs its own timer, that timer must always
  be armed for the EARLIEST pending deadline (a first-come "one is already
  scheduled" guard leaves a sooner-expiring card spinning), and it must be
  cleared in `destroy()` or it repaints the previous doc's threads over the
  next mount, which reuses the same DOM.
- Also retire a marker older than `lastActivity`: newer activity that
  queued nothing means the promised summary describes a state already gone.

## A corrective retry can DELETE the thing it was asked to fix

- **The word-cap retry was allowed to empty a summary line, because an
  empty line costs zero words and therefore satisfies the budget the retry
  was sent to satisfy.** `buildRetryNudge` returned null for
  `discussion: ""`, so the "compliant" blank answer beat a long-but-real
  first answer. Downstream, `threadLines` does `stored.discussion ||
  base.discussion`, so the card fell back to the raw latest comment — the
  verbatim snippet generation exists to REMOVE — and because the stored
  hash was current, nothing ever retried it. Found in production with one
  affected thread, three days after the retry shipped with four passing
  tests.
- Two guards, both one-directional: a retry may not blank a line the first
  answer filled (keep whichever answer HAS the line), and an empty
  discussion on a thread that has replies is itself a reason to ask again.
- **General rule: when you add a "fix it" round trip, state what the second
  answer must still CONTAIN, not only what it must not exceed.** Any
  validation phrased purely as an upper bound is satisfied by emptiness.

## "The store has it" is not "the surface can show it"

- **A reply to a resolved thread left the thread resolved, and the drawer's
  default Open tab drops resolved threads entirely** (`filtered()` in
  `threads.ts`), so a reviewer's reply three minutes after an agent resolved
  was invisible to them. It was reported as **"comments seem to be going
  missing"** — and a peer's first instinct was to check for data loss, which
  there wasn't: `list_threads` had all 26 threads with every word. Nothing is more
  corrosive to trust in a review surface than content that exists in the
  store and cannot be reached from the UI, because the failure presents as
  the worst possible bug (loss) while every backend check comes back clean.
- **The fix belongs at the one choke point**: `schemaPostReply` has exactly
  one caller (`Rooms.postComment`), and all three reply paths — browser REST,
  MCP `post_reply`, widget — funnel through it. A person's reply reopens; an
  agent's does not, because agents post closing notes ("done, removed it in
  <sha>") after a human resolves and resurrecting a just-closed thread is its
  own bug. `classifyActor` (activity.ts) already draws that line — reuse it
  rather than inventing a second notion of "is this an agent".
- **Residual, deliberately not fixed: the reverse ordering.** If the person's
  reply lands and the agent resolves *afterwards*, the reply is hidden again.
  The tempting guard — "don't let an agent resolve when the newest comment is
  a person's" — describes the NORMAL case (human asks, agent fixes, agent
  resolves), so it would block almost every legitimate resolve. A real fix
  needs a `resolvedAt` and an "activity since resolve" display rule.
- Status fields that gate visibility need an explicit way back IN, and the
  test for one belongs at the route layer: `postComment` is reachable three
  ways and the route is the layer no unit test covers.

## A flag nobody renders is not a feature — check the surface before believing the report

- **The task said "the board shades unproven moves". It didn't.** `unproven`
  was computed at transition time, returned to the caller, and put on the
  event — and consumed only by a transient toast in `hub-app.ts`. It was never
  persisted on the row and no surface rendered it. So the acceptance criterion
  "the shading clears once evidence lands" required first BUILDING the
  shading; taken literally it was satisfiable by changing nothing anyone could
  see.
- **Same family as "the store has it is not the surface can show it", inverted.**
  There the data existed and the UI could not reach it. Here the *bug report*
  assumed a surface that was never built — so the premise to reproduce is not
  only "does the bug happen", it is "does the thing the bug is about exist".
  A field on an event is not a feature until something renders it, and the
  distance between those two is invisible from the server side, where every
  check comes back correct.

## A media query adds no specificity, and forcing one ON for a test must not grant it any

- **A rule inside `@media` loses to an equal-specificity base rule LATER in
  the file.** Wrapping a declaration in a media query changes when it applies,
  never how strongly — so the phone row's `min-width: max-content` was
  authored, matched, and still lost to the plain rule below it. Nothing warns:
  the media query matches, devtools shows the rule, and the computed value
  comes from somewhere else.
- **A harness that forces media rules on must mutate `CSSMediaRule.media.mediaText`
  IN PLACE.** The first one unwrapped them into a fresh `<style>` appended to
  the document — which hands every unwrapped rule last-wins position and
  measures a cascade no browser produces. It reported `min-width: max-content`
  as applied while production computed `0px`. The harness was not merely
  imprecise; it inverted the exact ordering the bug lived in.
- Caught by `codex review`, confirmed in-browser, now covered by an ordering
  test. The reusable half is the second bullet: when a probe has to put the
  page into a state (a viewport, a media condition, a feature flag), reaching
  that state by REBUILDING the artifact instead of re-conditioning it is how a
  probe ends up measuring something the product never does. Same family as
  "a positive control scanning the wrong data".

## A touch gesture has TWO endings, and `pointercancel` is the common one

- **The comment pill was dead on mobile after the first scroll**, because
  `isDragging` (set on `pointerdown` over the doc, and checked by every path
  that can SHOW the pill — `positionPill`, prosemirror's `selectionUpdate`,
  the view-mode `selectionchange` fallback) was cleared only by `pointerup`.
  Mobile browsers fire **`pointercancel` instead of `pointerup`** whenever a
  touch is taken over by a system gesture: scrolling with a finger on the
  text (every session, within seconds), or iOS handing a long-press to its
  own selection UI. One cancelled touch wedged the flag for the rest of the
  page load, and nothing surfaced it — Bryan reported it as "no inline
  comments on mobile?", i.e. as a MISSING FEATURE rather than a bug.
- **Rule: if you set a flag on `pointerdown`, clear it on `pointerup` AND
  `pointercancel`.** A `touchcancel` companion is unnecessary — a browser
  without pointer events wouldn't have fired the `pointerdown` either.
- **A flag that gates an affordance's only entry point needs a watchdog.**
  The failure is silent and total, so `trackGesture` also self-settles after
  6s if neither terminator arrives. Deliberately one-directional: settling
  early can only SHOW the pill next to a real selection, where the
  alternative is a dead affordance.
- **A happy-dom unit test on the tracker cannot prove app.ts wires it** (the
  bug was entirely in the wiring). What proved it: build the bundle in a
  throwaway worktree, serve it on its own port + data dir, and run the same
  probe against the pre-fix and fixed bundles — `pointerdown` +
  `pointercancel` with no `pointerup`, then a selection. Pre-fix: pill
  hidden, still hidden on retry. Fixed: visible both times. Never rebuild
  `packages/markdown-app/dist` in the primary checkout to test an unmerged
  change — prod serves that directory per-request, so the "test build" is a
  deploy to the fleet.

## A prod restart reloads server code but NOT the served app bundle

- **A feature can be fully merged, the server restarted, and every browser
  still runs the pre-feature client.** The markdown-app is served from
  `packages/markdown-app/dist` (untracked, minified); prod
  (`serve.ts --no-watch`) deliberately runs no bundler, on the assumption
  "dist is built once at deploy time" — but nothing enforced that a deploy
  rebuilt it. Generated thread summaries (PR #105) merged at 12:39; dist was
  last built 11:37; the 1:46 restart reloaded the SERVER (which generated and
  stored summaries) while every card kept rendering raw snippets, because the
  served `app.js` had no summary code at all. Diagnosis tell: server REST
  state is correct, browser behavior is pre-feature → compare
  `dist/BUILD_INFO.txt` against the merge time FIRST. Note the bundle is
  minified, so grepping dist for source identifiers proves nothing — grep for
  string literals (`get("summary")`) or trust BUILD_INFO.
- **Grepping only the NEW bundle is still a vacuous probe: a literal
  discriminates only if it is 0 in the OLD bundle and non-zero in the new.**
  Check both, old one first. On a later deploy two of the first candidate
  literals were source COMMENTS — which the minifier strips, so their absence
  said nothing about whether the feature shipped — and a third was already in
  the pre-deploy bundle, so finding it said nothing either. Pick literals from
  runtime strings a user could see (visible copy, a CSS class that appears in
  the stylesheet), never comments or identifiers, both of which a minifier is
  entitled to remove. The pairs that worked: `Reconnecting` 0→1 and `Keep this
  tab open` 0→1 in `hub.js`, `save-state--offline` **1→2** in `styles.css` —
  that last is a COUNT rather than a presence, because the class already
  existed and only the un-hiding rule was new.
- **Keeping the previous release on disk is what makes the old-bundle half
  checkable at all.** The numbered-release mechanism ("Prod no longer serves the
  client out of a working tree", below) earns its keep as a verification tool,
  not only as a rollback path.
- Fix (this PR): prod `serve.ts` rebuilds the widget + markdown-app bundles
  once at startup, before the server spawns — restart == deploy. A failed
  build logs loudly and serves the existing dist (stale beats down).

## The restart that delivers the client cannot be the restart you measure

- **A prod restart IS the client deploy here (the entry above), so "open the
  page, restart, watch what the tab does" measures the PREVIOUS client.** The
  restart replaces what the server *hands out*; a tab that already loaded its
  bundle keeps executing the one it has. Nothing about the observation looks
  wrong — a real page, reconnecting for real, just not the build under test.
  Caught mid-verification of the reconnect behaviour only because the bundle
  being served when the pass started was still the pre-feature one; one step
  later the feature would have been reported verified against a client that did
  not contain it.
- **The sequence that works is restart → reload → restart.** The first restart
  publishes the new client, the reload gets the tab onto it, and the second
  restart is the one you actually measure. The first pass is delivery, not
  evidence.
- **General rule: when the thing you are testing is DELIVERED BY the event you
  are testing across, one pass cannot verify it** — one pass to deliver, a
  second to observe. Same family as "a negative test needs a positive control
  or it proves nothing" and "A truncated page read is indistinguishable from a
  page that never rendered": the probe ran, it just measured something other
  than what it claimed to.
- Two browser mechanics this verification leaned on — reaching a true 430px
  viewport, and what timer throttling does to a measured debounce — are written
  down in the `ux-review` skill, which is where someone checking a UI looks.

## Reviewing an unmerged build: run a staging instance, never rebuild in the primary checkout

- **`bun run staging`, from a linked worktree.** It builds the widget +
  markdown-app bundles in that worktree and starts the server on port 8788
  with a throwaway `data-staging/` dir. Prod keeps serving 8787 with its own
  data the entire time. This is what makes "get feedback before the PR
  merges" possible at all — previously the only way to see a branch's client
  changes was to merge it.
- **Two guardrails, both load-bearing, both encoded in the script rather than
  in someone's memory.** (1) It refuses to run from the primary checkout,
  because prod serves `packages/markdown-app/dist` from there *per request* —
  building bundles in the primary checkout is a deploy to the whole fleet, not
  a test build. Detection is `--git-dir == --git-common-dir`, which is true
  only in the main checkout. (2) It starts the server via
  `packages/server/src/bin.ts` (which takes `--port` / `--data-dir`) and NEVER
  via `scripts/serve.ts`, because `serve.ts` publishes the live port to the
  file the live-feedback MCP uses for discovery — running it would silently
  repoint every agent in the fleet at the staging build.
- **Pointing an agent at staging** needs `FEEDBACK_BASE_URL=http://<host>:8788`
  in its launch environment; the MCP checks that override before discovery.
  Read once at session start, so it needs a restart with the env set — same
  constraint as `FEEDBACK_AGENT_NAME`.
- **Staging data does not migrate.** Tasks and docs created there die with the
  data dir. So the shape is: evaluate on staging pre-merge, then do the real
  work once, after the merge. Don't ask a reviewer to enter real content twice.

## Prod no longer serves the client out of a working tree — publish, then switch

- **Two entries above say prod serves `packages/markdown-app/dist` from the
  primary checkout *per request*. That stopped being true** when prod started
  copying the built bundles into an immutable numbered release under the state
  root (`~/.local/state/live-feedback/client`, `LF_CLIENT_ROOT` to override)
  and serving that. A `git checkout` in the repo can no longer change what a
  browser loads. What survives unchanged: that checkout is prod's **deploy
  source**, so bundles built there still ship at the next restart — which is
  why `bun run staging` still refuses to run from it.
- **Any "swap what's being served" operation needs an intermediate nobody
  reads.** Copy into a dot-prefixed staging dir, `rename(2)` it into place (a
  release then exists completely or not at all), and move the `current`
  pointer by renaming a fresh symlink over it. Copying into the live directory
  has a window where the served tree is half-populated; there is no amount of
  ordering that removes it. The server is handed the RESOLVED release path, so
  no request can resolve half a path either side of a swap.
- **Release ids must sort in publish order.** The first cut used a
  seconds-granularity timestamp plus a random suffix, so "keep the newest N"
  was a coin flip between same-second releases and the prune test failed
  intermittently-by-construction. Millisecond stamp + a fixed-width counter.
- The full picture of what reaches whom, and how, is
  [delivery.md](delivery.md) — read that before answering "why doesn't my peer
  have this yet".

## Server lifecycle on the Mac Mini

- The live-feedback server has no auto-restart story today. If it crashes
  while Bryan is mobile, his bound docs stop accepting new edits via the
  /review URL (browser shows reconnect loop with `data:` flicker). Restart
  recovers state from `.ydoc` files cleanly. PR #31 ships a launchd
  supervisor; PR #33 fixes the install-time gotchas (see below).
- `bun --watch` does NOT reliably reload on changes to deeply-imported
  files. After landing a server-side fix, restart manually
  (`pkill -f bin.ts && bun run dev`) to verify it's loaded.

## macOS launchd + non-default home volume

- **TCC blocks launchd-spawned processes from reading `/Volumes/<X>/Users/...`
  by default**, even if the user's actual home directory lives there (via
  `/Users/<name>` symlink). Symptom: launchd reports the service "running"
  but the process never writes to stdout/stderr, never binds its port,
  never spawns children. `sample <pid>` shows 100% time in
  `__open_nocancel` because the kernel is returning `EPERM` on `getcwd()`
  ancestor walks and the language runtime retries instead of surfacing.
  Confirm with a minimal test plist running `/bin/sh -c "pwd"` — you'll
  see `getcwd: cannot access parent directories: Operation not permitted`.
  Fix: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access → add the
  binary (e.g. `~/.bun/bin/bun`). Shell-spawned processes inherit
  Terminal's TCC scope and don't hit this — only launchd does.
- **`launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u)` is the modern entry point.**
  `launchctl load/unload` is deprecated on macOS 11+; `kickstart -k` is
  the modern way to force-restart a supervised service.
- **`KeepAlive` must include `SuccessfulExit=false`** to avoid a restart
  loop when the service exits cleanly (e.g. on `pkill -TERM`). Pair with
  `Crashed=true` so launchd respawns after a real crash.

## File-binding semantics

- `create_review_doc` is idempotent and re-runnable. Calling it again on
  an existing docId with the same `path` re-runs `attachFile`, which
  re-wires the `observeDeep` listener without re-seeding from disk
  (the seed path is gated on empty fragment). Useful as a recovery tool
  for half-attached docs.
- `attachFile` only re-seeds from disk when the in-memory fragment is
  empty. Once seeded, the in-memory state wins; disk content only
  re-enters via `fs.watch` change events or explicit
  `reparse_from_disk(docId)`.

## Markdown editor footguns

- CSS Grid `1fr` = `minmax(auto, 1fr)`, where `auto` is content-driven.
  Any cell with `1fr` can grow past viewport if its content has long
  unbreakable strings. Use `minmax(0, 1fr)` to force shrink-to-fit.
  Cost a full mobile-overflow PR cycle (PR #22 vs PR #23) to root-cause.
- URLs sent to Bryan must NOT be wrapped in markdown bold/italic/links.
  Some of his clients autolink URLs but don't render markdown, so
  `**https://x.com**` becomes a clickable link that includes the trailing
  `**` and 404s. Always send a bare URL on its own line.

## Bound-doc sync contract (the answer to "is disk-editing a bound file safe?")

- Third time a fleet peer needed this spelled out, so: **disk writes into a
  bound .md merge cleanly when the live doc is idle** (500ms mtime poll →
  `decideReconcile` → block-level LCS apply; thread anchors and pending
  suggestions on unchanged blocks survive). **Against un-flushed live edits
  they LOSE by design** (editor = runtime source of truth): the file is
  reasserted from the live doc and a `syncError` is recorded on the binding
  — detected, not silent, but the write is gone. So: MCP edit tools by
  default on bound docs; direct Write/Edit only when nobody's live, and
  check `syncError` after.
- `reparse_from_disk` is **recovery-only**, never "make my disk write
  stick": if the flush reasserted between your write and the reparse, the
  reparse faithfully pulls the OLD bytes back. Known gap: reparse drops
  pending suggestions in rewritten blocks silently (backlog).
- **Diff-review .md members are bound LAZILY** — a companion doc (with
  write-back) exists only once someone opens that file's redline/File view.
  Unopened members are plain files; normal tools are fine. `list_docs`
  shows which companions exist.
- Backlog (peer request): emit a `syncError` event on the doc's watch
  channel (docId, relPath, dropped sids) so a lost write announces itself
  the way comment events do.
- `FEEDBACK_AGENT_NAME` is read ONCE at MCP-child start from the session's
  LAUNCH environment — an MCP reconnect picks up new tool schemas but never
  a new name. Attribution changes require a full session restart with the
  env set (launcher config, not an agent-side action).

## Multi-agent workflow implementation (balloons + suggestions pattern)

- **The recipe that shipped two features with <30 min human hands-on:**
  one persistent worktree; a Workflow of sequential TDD implement-agents
  (one per planned commit, each passing structured `{commit, testsPass,
  concerns}` context to the next); a parallel 3-lens review (dimension
  prompts tailored to the feature's real risks); a fix agent that VERIFIES
  findings before fixing; then, outside the workflow: orchestrator re-runs
  the full suites itself, independent `codex review` pass, merge main into
  the branch, PR. Cheaper models on mechanical commits/reviews, strongest
  model on the incident-prone paths. The layers genuinely disagree —
  Codex caught what the 3-lens pass rated advisory (added-vs-empty-base)
  or missed (proposal isolation, inline-mark loss); 8 real pre-merge bugs
  total across the two runs. Keep both layers even when one is clean.
- Long-running feature branches that APPEND to shared files (styles.css)
  conflict at merge; merge main into the branch before the final
  commit/PR, and resolve both-appended-at-EOF conflicts by keeping both
  blocks and re-closing the braces (check `{`/`}` balance).

## A leak gate that can't see still exits 0 — and reports it as a pass

- **The pre-push scanner's registry half was dead for weeks and nothing said
  so.** `FLEET_REGISTRY` pointed at a fleet repo path that a rename had
  removed, so `find_registry()` returned None, zero project names compiled,
  and every push passed the project-name check by not running it. The one
  guard that existed printed "no patterns configured" only when the pattern
  list was **completely** empty — and the 15 hand-curated denylist patterns
  kept it non-empty, so the guard never fired. The canonical copy in the fleet
  repo had the same bug mirrored: right registry path, denylist path pointing
  at a file that didn't exist. Each half worked in exactly one copy.
- **Rule: a missing source must fail, not warn.** A stderr line in a pre-push
  hook scrolls past under normal push output. "Expected" is inferred rather
  than declared — if *either* source resolved, this is a configured machine
  and both are expected, so a missing one is exit 2; if *neither* resolved,
  it's a stranger's clone with no config to be missing, so skip cleanly.
- **Resolve moving paths from a candidate list, current first.** Both of these
  paths moved once already. A candidate list turns the next rename into a
  fallback instead of a silent no-op.
- **An env override must be authoritative, never the head of the fallback
  chain.** `SCRUB_REGISTRY=/fixture` falling back to the real machine config
  would let a self-test pass against the wrong data — the same "I scanned
  something, just not what you think" failure, one level up.
- **`scripts/scrub-selftest.py` is the part that keeps it fixed.** Nine cases
  against temp fixtures, each planting something the scanner MUST find or
  asserting a specific refusal, wired into CI *and* into the hook itself
  (CI never runs the hook, and the hook is where the gate actually lives).
  Verified non-vacuous by mutation: deleting the `public: true` drop fails one
  case, turning the refusal back into a pass fails three.
- **How this was found is the reusable part:** the scan came back clean, and
  instead of believing it I fed the scanner a pattern it was supposed to
  catch. It didn't catch it. Same lesson as "a negative test needs a positive
  control", now with a production instance — and note the earlier report of
  "regex layer clean" was doubly wrong, because `scrub-check.py` takes file
  paths or `--diff-range` and **ignores stdin**, so piping content at it
  scans nothing and exits 0.

## A self-test is green until it runs on a machine that isn't yours

- **The fix for the gate above shipped with two bugs, and every one of its
  eleven cases passed on my machine.** A peer ran the same suite in the
  canonical repo and two failed immediately. The entire difference: **this
  repo has no `registry.yaml` at its root and that one does**, so
  `find_registry()`'s repo-local branch never executed here and executed every
  time there. The bugs weren't subtle — the local lookup ran *before* the
  `SCRUB_REGISTRY` override, so a self-test pointing at a fixture silently read
  the real fleet registry, found none of its planted names, and reported clean.
  **A positive control scanning the wrong data is worse than no control**, and
  it is the exact failure an authoritative override exists to prevent, one
  level above the bug being fixed. Rule: when a code path is gated on an
  environmental fact (a file exists at the repo root, a platform, a config
  present), the suite must construct BOTH shapes — here, `git init` a temp repo
  with a `registry.yaml` in it — because the shape you develop in is the one
  you will never test.
- **Some rows are unreachable from the environment by design, and that's where
  dead code hides.** The second bug — a stranger's clone getting every push
  refused, citing config paths that were never theirs — needed "no machine
  config, but this repo tracks its own registry". No env override can produce
  it: an authoritative override *suppresses* the repo-local lookup, which is
  the point of it. So "just run it in the other repo shape" cannot cover it.
  The fix is a seam: `decide_sources(registry, fleet_registry, denylist,
  require_sources)` is pure and table-tested over all eight combinations, with
  the end-to-end cases layered on top. **A branch reachable only in the field
  is untested by construction.**
- **Two spellings of "not found" is a bug generator.** `None` from the
  resolver and "a path that doesn't exist" from the old constants coexisted;
  each downstream guard picked a different one, and the escape-hatch branch
  became unreachable while reading as correct. One spelling, held everywhere.
- **Infer "is this machine configured" from machine-level facts only.** A
  repo-local `registry.yaml` arrives with the clone, so counting it as evidence
  turns every stranger into a fleet machine with a broken install.
- **The file a scanner skips is the file where the leak gets written.**
  `scrub-check.py` is in its own `SKIP_PATHS` (it quotes denylist keywords as
  examples, so scanning it blocks its own propagation) — and a private project
  name had been sitting in it, in this public repo, as the example for the
  word-boundary regex. Guaranteed-unscanned is exactly where an example name
  goes. Audit skip-listed files by hand, on a schedule, since no gate will.
- **A false positive on a REMOVAL is the worst false positive available.** The
  Haiku layer blocked the push of the commit that deleted that name, reading
  the `-` line as content going public. Blocking the fix is how a gate teaches
  people to reach for `SCRUB_SKIP=1`. The prompt now judges added lines only,
  verified both directions (an added leak still exits 1).

## A restart can move a session BACKWARDS a plugin version

- **The plugin resolves from a version-keyed CACHE, not from this checkout.**
  `claude-live-feedback` is registered as a **GitHub-source** marketplace, so
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` points at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/...`, and a merge
  to main changes nothing anywhere until someone runs
  `claude plugin update live-feedback@claude-live-feedback`.
- **The failure mode this produces is counter-intuitive and cost a full
  restart cycle.** A session whose MCP child happened to be launched against
  the working tree was running 0.1.15; the respawn dropped it onto the cache,
  which was still at 0.1.12. So the restart — done specifically to pick up new
  tools — **removed** them. Confirmed by grepping the two bundles:
  `set_task_dependencies` appears 2x in the 0.1.15 bundle and 0x in 0.1.12.
- **`claude plugin update` is the deploy step; the restart only picks up
  whatever the cache holds at that moment.** The CLAUDE.md bullet above said
  "merge, then the peer restarts", which reads as though the restart is what
  delivers. It isn't, and the order matters: update, THEN restart. Restarting
  first gets you the old version and looks like the merge didn't work.
- **Verify from inside the session, not from a spawned child.** A subagent
  gets its own MCP connection and proves nothing about the parent's. The
  check that counts is `ToolSearch` for the new tool name in the session that
  needs it, followed by an actual call against real data.
- **Consequence for a fleet: a merge does not deliver.** After one update ran,
  exactly one peer was on 0.1.15 and eight were still on 0.1.12, each picking
  it up whenever it next happened to restart. So "is this feature available?"
  has a different answer per peer, and any feature whose value ships inside
  the bundle (a skill, a tool description) can't meet its acceptance until
  delivery stops needing a person.

## A shell wrapper made an agent conclude it was forbidden from deploying

- **`claude` is a shell FUNCTION on this machine** — it re-invokes the real
  binary with `"${CLAUDE_CHANNEL_FLAGS[@]}" "$@"` — so the flags land ahead of the
  subcommand and `claude plugin update …` is parsed as a prompt: *"Input must
  be provided either through stdin or as a prompt argument when using
  --print"*. Reproduced on `plugin list`, which is read-only: the function
  form errors, `command claude plugin list` prints the plugins. It fails even
  with that array empty, so it is the wrapper, not the flags.
- **That error reads exactly like a permission refusal**, and a ticket
  recorded it as one: "the one-line fix is not mine to run", generalised into
  an agent being unable to deploy at all. It was a footgun, not a wall. Fix:
  `command` bypasses functions and aliases — `command claude plugin update
  live-feedback@claude-live-feedback`.
- Same family as "X is impossible measured AN absence, not THE absence".
  Before writing down that a capability is denied you, check whether what
  refused you was the tool or a wrapper around it: `type -a <cmd>` costs one
  line and would have saved this one a ticket and a fleet-wide belief.

## Drift you have to go and look for is drift nobody looks for

- **`main` reached 0.1.26 while every peer's cache sat at 0.1.15 — eleven
  releases, none delivered, nothing said so.** Each one was merged and green.
  The only detector was a person deciding to check, and the reason nobody did
  is that there was no moment that prompted it: a merge looks like shipping.
  The fix is not a better reminder, it is a reading — sessions report the
  bundle they are RUNNING on `attach_agent`, and the board names anyone older
  than what the deploy source would install.
- **Report the version the session is running, not the one its cache holds.**
  Those disagree from the moment an update runs until the session restarts,
  and the running one is the only one that decides whether a tool exists for
  that agent. A cache-based signal would go quiet at the update and hide the
  half of the problem that is still open.
- **A peer that reports NO version is behind, not unknown.** The field ships
  in the release that reads it, so silence means "older than this feature" —
  which is the state of the entire fleet the day it lands. Treating absence as
  unknown would have hidden precisely the drift it was built for. The mirror
  rule: a session AHEAD of the deploy source is *not* behind (an agent
  launched against a working tree legitimately outruns an unpulled checkout),
  and nagging it to downgrade is worse than silence.
- **A stale staging instance answers as though it were your build.** Port 8788
  was still held by an earlier `bun run staging`, so the new one moved to 8789
  and printed so — while a probe at 8788 returned a clean, complete, entirely
  wrong answer (no `pluginRelease` at all, which reads as "my feature is
  broken"). Read the port the run actually bound before pointing anything at
  it; same shape as a positive control scanning the wrong data.

## What makes a fleet-wide action safe is that it can't interrupt anybody

- **The condition for letting every peer trigger a plugin refresh was that it
  must not interrupt work in progress — and the honest answer was that the
  mechanism already couldn't.** `claude plugin update` writes a version-keyed
  cache directory and moves a pointer; every running session keeps loading the
  path it resolved at launch. The thing that interrupts is the RESTART, and
  that stays the peer's. So "requests a refresh rather than forcing one" is a
  property of what the operation touches, not a queue or a consent protocol
  bolted on top. **Before designing the safety mechanism, check whether the
  operation is already safe** — the first design here was a request queue with
  per-peer safe points, for an action that cannot reach another session at all.
- **Then it also runs on a timer, and that is the actual fix.** A tool every
  peer *can* call is still a tool somebody has to decide to call, which is the
  same failure that let eleven releases go undelivered. Prod polls the update
  every 30 minutes, so a merge lands in the cache with nobody involved.
- **Never trust the updater's own account of what it did.** `claude plugin
  update` prints success when it copies nothing. `changed` is computed by
  reading `installed_plugins.json` before and after — mutation-tested by
  switching it to parse the CLI's "updated from X to Y" prose, which turns the
  test red. Same family as "a peer agent's 'it worked' means the call didn't
  error".
- **A capability that spawns a process needs a seam, and the seam is the
  test-safety story.** The refresher is constructed in exactly one place
  (`bin.ts`, behind a flag only `serve.ts --no-watch` passes), so no test run,
  no `bun run staging`, and no embedded server can mutate this machine's plugin
  cache. Without that, a CI run would be a fleet deploy. Same rule the
  summarizer follows, for the same reason.
- **The route-level auth check was unreachable, and my test for it passed with
  the check deleted.** `shareScopeAllows` is a closed-by-default allowlist that
  runs before any route, so a share host never reaches `/api/plugin/refresh`
  and `visitor` can never be truthy there. The end-to-end test was measuring
  the allowlist while claiming to measure the route. Fixed by asserting at the
  layer the gate lives in (with a positive control), and by labelling the route
  check as the defense-in-depth it actually is. **Mutation-test a guard you
  just added; "it returns 403" does not tell you which line said so.**

## git exports GIT_DIR into hooks, and `git init` inherits it

- **`git push` → `pre-push` hook → a script that runs `git init` somewhere
  else set `core.bare = true` on the primary checkout**, which then failed
  every subsequent command with "this operation must be run in a work tree".
  git exports `GIT_DIR` (and friends) into every hook it runs; a `git init`
  carrying that inherited env does not initialize its own `cwd` — it
  re-initializes the repo `GIT_DIR` names.
- **Only one env shape is destructive, and it is the one a worktree
  produces.** Probed all four empirically rather than guessing: plain-repo
  `GIT_DIR` → harmless, `GIT_DIR` + `GIT_WORK_TREE` → harmless, relative
  `.git` → harmless, **linked-worktree gitdir as `GIT_DIR` → writes
  `core.bare = true` into the shared config**, i.e. the primary checkout's.
  Fix: strip every `GIT_*` key from the environment before invoking `git
  init` in a fixture builder.
- **Stripping `GIT_*` also removes `GIT_AUTHOR_*` / `GIT_COMMITTER_*`**, so a
  fixture commit then needs `-c user.email=... -c user.name=...`. CI runners
  have no global identity and a bare `git commit` exits 128 — which is
  exactly how this shipped green locally and went red on the runner, for the
  third time in this file.
- **Two consecutive drafts of the regression test passed with the fix
  removed.** (1) The victim repo was a plain repo, which `git init`
  harmlessly reinitializes; (2) the hook gitdir was built as
  `.git/worktrees/<branch>`, but `git worktree add <dir> -b <branch>` names
  the gitdir after the **directory**, so the path never existed and the
  scenario never ran. The test only went red for the right reason after it
  built a real linked worktree and asked git for the path
  (`git rev-parse --absolute-git-dir` from inside it) — plus an assertion
  that the path resolves at all. **A fixture that constructs the wrong shape
  is the default outcome, not the unlucky one; assert the shape before
  asserting the behaviour.**
- How it was finally found is the reusable part: three sessions of
  hypothesising (worktree spawn? worktree removal?) got nowhere. A 1s poll
  recording every `core.bare` transition alongside a `ps` snapshot caught the
  flip to the second, with the culprit process in the snapshot. Instrument
  rather than theorise once a second hypothesis has died.

## "X is impossible" measured AN absence, not THE absence

- **A beta report said a task body is immutable — `PATCH` and `PUT` both
  404, measured not guessed — and it was wrong.** A task body is not a
  field, it's a live Yjs room (`task:<taskId>`), and `set_doc_content` on
  that docId already rewrote it. The report probed the two verbs a REST
  field would have and missed the door that was open. Reproducing the
  capability first (throwaway workspace → thin task → rewrite → read back
  through `get_doc` AND `next_tasks`) took two minutes and changed the
  shape of the work: not "make the body mutable" but "make the existing
  write findable, immediate, and attributed."
- **Rule: reproduce the impossibility before building the fix.** A fix
  that follows a wrong premise is usually the wrong SIZE — here it would
  have been a whole mutable-field path parallel to a room that already
  worked. Same family as "a peer agent's 'it worked' means the call didn't
  error": a confident measurement bounds what was tried, not what exists.
- The real gaps all shared a failure signature — each one presents to the
  caller as *"the rewrite didn't work"*: no named route (reachable only by
  knowing the docId convention), a debounced snapshot so rewrite-then-read
  returns the OLD body, no audit row, and a `delete_doc`'d body room
  answering `not-found` (which reads as "no such task" when the task is
  fine). When a capability exists but everyone reports it missing, look for
  the ring of things around it rather than at it.

## A truncated page read is indistinguishable from a page that never rendered

- **An orchestrating session read the live workspace board in Chrome, reported
  the quick-add form and every task row and goal section absent from the DOM,
  and escalated it as a production regression** — blaming four just-merged PRs,
  retracting a completed task, and holding a deploy. There was no bug.
  `read_page` truncates at 50,000 characters by default; the board's
  accessibility tree was ~24,413 characters **and grows with the task count**.
  DOM order inside `.hub-board-col` is `hub-controls` → `hub-decisions` (the
  REST-fed review strip, which rendered fine) → **`hub-quick`** → **`hub-board`**,
  so the two "missing" regions are exactly the next two siblings after the last
  thing the read showed. A snapshot tool truncates at the BOTTOM, which is where
  the content you are asking about usually is.
- **Rule: before reporting that an element is absent from a page, run a query
  that can SEE it** — `document.querySelector` via `javascript_tool`, or a
  `read_page` with an explicit high `max_chars` or a `ref_id` scoped to the
  region. Absence inferred from a rendered snapshot bounds what the snapshot
  held, not what the page holds. Same family as "a negative test needs a
  positive control or it proves nothing" and "'X is impossible' measured AN
  absence, not THE absence" — with the twist that here the blinding was a
  default argument nobody passed, so nothing in the session looked wrong.
- **Treat the truncation footer as load-bearing, not boilerplate.** It is the
  only thing separating "the page lacks this" from "I stopped reading", and it
  is what closed the diagnosis: re-running with `max_chars: 3300` reproduced
  the bogus report item for item, in order, then cut at the same seam. The
  positive control ran both ways too — emptying `#hub-quick` and `#hub-board`
  made the probe say exactly what the bad report said, and restoring them
  flipped it back. One detail made the false report convincing: the sole
  survivor was the `position: fixed` "Hold to talk" mic button, which outlives
  any truncation or scroll position and reads like the last fragment of a
  broken page.
- **The report was also structurally impossible under the deployed code, and
  checking that is cheaper than raising an alarm.** `renderReviewStrip` has one
  call site, in `renderBoardRegion`, *after* `renderBoard`; `renderBoard` opens
  with `container.replaceChildren()`, so a null container throws rather than
  no-ops; and `boardSections` unconditionally emits one section per goal plus a
  Chores section, so it can never return `[]`. "Review strip with 7 rows"
  therefore entails "at least one section in the DOM". When a browser
  observation and the code cannot both be true, suspect the observation first.

## A modal the page AWAITS makes every absence on that page vacuous

- **Verifying that the feedback widget correctly does NOT render for a share
  visitor, the first probe found no widget — and no board, no sections, no
  rows either.** That second half is what saved it: hub `main()` *awaits*
  `ensureUserIdentity`, and a first-time visitor is held at the "Who's
  reviewing?" prompt, so until someone answers it `#hub-root` has zero
  children. The widget was genuinely absent, on a page where *everything* was
  absent, which proves nothing about the suppression under test. Dismissing
  the prompt and re-running gave a fully rendered board with the widget still
  gone — that is the result worth reporting.
- **The positive control has to be a peer of the thing you're asserting away,
  on the same page, in the same pass.** "The server responded 200" and "the
  bundle loaded" were both true here and neither distinguishes the two
  worlds. What distinguished them was counting board rows next to the missing
  widget. Same family as "a negative test needs a positive control" and "a
  truncated page read is indistinguishable from a page that never rendered",
  with the blinding one layer earlier: not a truncated read of a rendered
  page, but a complete read of a page that had not rendered yet.
- **An await in front of a render is invisible from the server side**, where
  every check comes back correct — so grep the client entry point for what it
  awaits before mounting, and satisfy each of those before measuring anything
  about the DOM. A blocking prompt, a permission request, an auth redirect,
  and a lazy import all produce the same empty-container reading.
- Two mechanics that cost a pass each while getting there: Chrome will not
  store a `Secure` share cookie on a non-trustworthy origin, so a
  `*.nip.io`-style host silently drops the visitor session (`*.localhost` is
  trustworthy AND resolves to loopback, and an exact-match trusted-local
  check still classifies it as a share host); and screenshot coordinates are
  not CSS pixels — measure the scale with a `pointerdown` logger and recompute
  from `getBoundingClientRect()` rather than clicking where the picture says.

## A new emitted event reaches the surface as a bare slug

- **`task.body_edited` rode the existing SSE + `events.jsonl` path to the
  activity feed the moment it was emitted — and rendered as the literal
  string `task.body_edited`, with no actor and no task title**, because
  `describeEvent`'s switch had no case for it. The fallback is deliberate
  ("a table miss should be visible, not blank"), which is exactly why it
  doesn't count as handling: nothing goes red, the row just reads like a
  log line in a view built for people. **Emitting a new store event is two
  changes, and the second one is in the client.**
- **Two tests, because either alone is the "true but proves nothing about
  the caller" shape**: one that the switch has a case (hand-written row),
  and one in `activity-lines.test.ts` that drives the real route, reads the
  real `events.jsonl` back, and renders THAT row — which is what proves the
  emitted keys match the ones the case reads. Verified by mutation in both
  directions: delete the case, and blank `taskId` in the emit.

## A malformed anchor crashes a request that never touched the doc

- **`POST /api/docs/:id/threads` takes `anchor` verbatim and validates
  nothing.** A hand-written `text-range` with no `startRel`/`endRel` is
  accepted, stored, and then kills the re-anchor sweep with
  `Y.decodeRelativePosition(undefined)` — thrown inside a Yjs observer, so
  it surfaces as an unhandled async `TypeError` on whatever request or test
  happens to be running by then. Cost a full diagnosis pass: the server
  suite went red in `ws-meta-leak.test.ts` (`decoder.arr.length`
  undefined), a file the branch never touched.
- **Use `/threads/by_find` in fixtures.** It builds the RelativePositions
  from the doc, which is the only way to get an anchor that is actually an
  anchor.
- The method that found it, again: baseline unmodified `main` (green),
  baseline the worktree (1 failure), then remove only the new TEST file —
  green. That sequence proves the source innocent before you start reading
  it, and points at the fixture.
- **Fixed in two halves, and shipping either alone would have been wrong.**
  `anchors.validateAnchor` refuses the write at the route with a 400 that
  names the field — which only helps NEW writes. Docs written before it
  existed still carry bad anchors, so every reader also goes through
  `decodeRelativePositionSafe`, which answers null where Yjs would throw.
  Null is indistinguishable at the call site from "this position no longer
  resolves", the case every reader already handles — so a legacy bad anchor
  doesn't merely stop crashing, the snippet sweep re-anchors it and the doc
  repairs itself. **A validation-only fix leaves the already-broken docs
  broken, and those are the ones somebody is looking at.**
- Two more things the fix had to reach that the report didn't name. The
  `/threads/<id>/reanchor` route takes an anchor verbatim too — it can plant
  the same thing on an EXISTING thread. And `anchor.snippet.text` is the same
  deferred crash one property deeper: `snippet` is required by the type and by
  nothing that enforces it, and the sweep is where a missing one is first
  read. When a route accepts a structure verbatim, grep for every route that
  accepts that same structure, and for every property the readers dereference
  without a guard.
- **The test that proves it asserts on a request to a different doc.** The
  edit that arms the sweep returns 200 either way; the failure lands ~250ms
  later on a bystander doc with no threads. A `process.on('uncaughtException')`
  collector is what makes it attributable — without one the run just dies
  somewhere else, which is the entire diagnosis cost. Mutation-tested five
  ways: removing either route guard, un-guarding the decode, and un-guarding
  the snippet read each turn a specific named test red, with the original
  `decoder.arr.length` error and the `# Unhandled error between tests` banner
  reproduced verbatim.

## A fallback that only logs is a fallback nobody knows they are on

- **`prepareClientRelease` keeping the previous client alive when the build
  fails is correct — and it left NOTHING on disk.** Reproduced before
  building anything: publish once, fail twice, and the release root still
  holds exactly `releases/` and `current`. The decision lived in a stderr
  line in a launchd log and in a return value whose `stale` field no reader
  anywhere consumed. So the failure path silently reintroduced the very
  server-new/client-old split the release mechanism exists to prevent.
  **General rule: a graceful degradation needs a durable trace, because the
  process that degraded exits and the question gets asked days later.**
- **The trace has to answer "how far behind", not "is something wrong".**
  A boolean cannot distinguish minutes from a week, and the gap is the
  entire reason to care. Provenance inside each release (published-at plus
  the source commit) plus a failure ledger beside them is enough for a
  surface to say the whole sentence.
- **Record the SOURCE as well as the clock.** A stale checkout builds
  successfully and stamps a current timestamp on old code, so a fresh-looking
  release id proves nothing about the code in it. `git describe --always
  --dirty` at publish costs one spawn per deploy and makes the release
  self-describing.
- **An alarm needs an arming rule with a stated silence.** Two failed starts
  in a row, or one over a client already older than a day; a single failure
  over a client published minutes ago says nothing. Without the silence the
  first transient bundler hiccup trains everyone to ignore the strip — and
  with a count-only rule a single failure that nobody ever retries stays
  silent forever while the gap grows. Both halves were mutation-tested
  (delete either clause and a named test goes red).
- **Only the process that PUBLISHED may report on the publish.** Dev and
  staging serve their own checkout's `dist` while sharing this machine's
  default release root, so a root-derived signal there would report prod's
  deploy state on a board that is not serving prod's client. Same seam as the
  plugin refresher: one flag, passed in one place (`serve.ts --no-watch`).
- **The hub's top-level script is the layer no unit test reaches.**
  `hub-app.ts` has no exports and mounts on load, so the model and render
  tests cannot prove it is wired. What proved it: build the bundles in a
  linked worktree, start `bin.ts` on its own port and data dir against a
  fixture release root with a failing ledger, and read `.hub-drift` out of a
  real browser. Same method as the `pointercancel` fix, and it is the only
  thing that would have caught a dropped state assignment.

## Removing an MCP tool cannot break a peer — the shared server is where a removal bites

- **`create_task` was left reachable for five releases behind a stated
  precondition — "no session older than 0.1.36" — and the precondition was
  unnecessary.** The reasoning it encoded ("a release that deletes the tool
  breaks every session still running an older bundle and still calling it")
  does not survive reading the code. Each session launches its OWN MCP child
  from its OWN version-keyed cache (`.mcp.json` → `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/mcp/index.js`),
  and BOTH halves of a tool live in that one file: the declaration is a static
  array literal in the `ListToolsRequestSchema` handler (no `await`, no
  `http()`, no `fetch` anywhere in its ~1,300 lines), and the dispatch is a
  `switch` in the same bundle. A session that has not restarted never sees the
  deletion; the restart that delivers it is the same restart that delivers the
  replacement. The shared server on :8787 has **no knowledge of the tool
  surface at all** — grep it for `tools/list`, `ListTools`, `toolNames`,
  `allowedTools`: zero hits. It never negotiates or serves a tool list, and
  `pluginVersion` reaches it only as a value to *display* on the drift strip,
  never as a gate.
- **The hazard the precondition was reaching for is real, but it is one layer
  down: the REST route, not the verb.** An old bundle keeps calling
  `POST /api/workspaces/:id/tasks` with whatever payload *that* bundle sends,
  and gets a failure it cannot explain from its own version. So the question
  worth asking at a removal is never "did I delete a tool somebody still
  calls" — it is **"did I narrow anything the old callers still send or still
  read"**. Diffing tool lists cannot see that.
- **Test the OLD payload, not the current one.** A route test written against
  what today's code sends passes by construction and detects nothing. The
  guard here transcribes the request keys and the dereferenced response fields
  out of the committed bundle at the oldest release plausibly still in the
  field (0.1.20 — verified byte-identical at 0.1.25/0.1.30/0.1.34/0.1.36) and
  sends exactly those. Mutation-verified: making the route drop `quote` turns
  it red.
- **Same shape as "What makes a fleet-wide action safe is that it can't
  interrupt anybody", one entry up.** There a whole consent mechanism was
  designed for an operation that already could not reach another session.
  Here a delivery gate held a removal for five releases against a breakage
  that was structurally impossible. Both times the fix was to read what the
  operation actually touches before designing around what it might.
  **Cost of checking: about twenty minutes of reading. Cost of not checking:
  a blocked task, a blocked dependent, and a session restart requested to
  satisfy a gate that was measuring nothing.**
- **An absence assertion on a name that is a PREFIX of the surviving name is
  the trap here.** `create_task` is a substring of `create_tasks`, so
  `BUNDLE.includes('create_task')` is true forever and an absence test written
  that way can never fail. Use `/create_task\b/` (no boundary between `k` and
  `s`), and assert the naive form still matches, so the guard fails loudly if
  the surviving verb is ever renamed.
- **Assert the absence in the SOURCE as well as the bundle, and expect them to
  disagree.** The first run had the bundle test green and the source test red
  — because the only remaining mention was in a code COMMENT, which the
  bundler strips. That is the mirror of the deploy-verification rule ("a
  literal from a comment proves nothing about the bundle"): comments are
  invisible to the artifact, so the bundle can look clean while the source
  still documents the thing as present.

## An empty list is a clearance only if you also render the denominator

- **The plugin-drift strip rendered NOTHING when nobody was behind, and
  nothing reads exactly like all-clear.** Its domain is "sessions that called
  `attach_agent` on this board", which for most of this board's life has been
  one member — itself. Measured 2026-08-17: `behind: []` over one attachment,
  while a fleet enumerated *outside* this server (the positive control: a
  second source, not a second look at the same data) had sessions releases
  back. **The only session the strip had ever named as behind was the session
  that then fixed itself** — which moved the reading from "names one" straight
  to "names nobody" with zero change in the actual drift. Worse than the
  filed prediction, which was about a board with *zero* attachments; one does
  it too, and one is the normal state.
- **A surface whose domain is "whoever opted in" measures PARTICIPATION, not
  the thing it is named after** — and the members least likely to have opted
  in are exactly the ones the surface exists to catch, because opting in is
  itself something the newer version does more of. Whenever a check runs over
  a self-selected population, ship the denominator beside the result and let
  the reader see how small it is.
- **Reproduce the constraint before working around it.** The honest answer
  here was "the fleet is unknowable from this server": a plugin version
  arrives through exactly one door (`attach_agent`'s `pluginVersion`), the MCP
  child makes no HTTP call at startup and never opens a websocket, and Yjs
  awareness carries browsers rather than agents. So the fix is to state the
  domain, NOT to invent a registry that makes a broader sentence true. Note
  the near-miss: the server *does* record agents that never attached
  (`activity.jsonl`, per-workspace `events.jsonl`) — but those carry no
  version, so they can name an unchecked session and can never call one
  behind. "Unknowable" had to be established per-fact, not per-surface.
- **The always-on line needs its own visual weight.** A coverage notice
  renders permanently, so it gets a quiet class; styling it like the alarm
  would train everyone to skim past the alarm. Same reasoning as an alarm
  needing a stated silence.
- Mutation-tested three ways, each turning a *named* test red: restoring the
  `return null` on an empty `behind`, dropping `checked` from the route
  payload, and dropping the quiet class in the renderer.

## gh pr merge --delete-branch switches your working copy to main

- When the branch being deleted is the CURRENT branch of the main
  checkout, `gh pr merge N --squash --delete-branch` checks out main
  locally (and tries to pull, which fails on a diverged local main with
  "Not possible to fast-forward" — harmless). The REMOTE merge succeeded;
  but your working tree just silently changed branches, so files appear to
  "revert" to pre-branch content. Bit us twice in one session. Run the
  merge from a checkout that is NOT on the branch, or expect the switch.
