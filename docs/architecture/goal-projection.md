# Goal projection — the bar, the remainder and the date

What a goal band prints: how far along it is, how much of Bryan's own
attention is left, and roughly when it lands. The arithmetic is four files in
`packages/core/src`, read bottom-up: `effort-task.ts` (what one ticket
contributes), `effort-calibration.ts` (the ratios and their priors),
`goal-effort.ts` (the rollup and the projected date) and `effort-format.ts`
(the readouts). All pure, and in `core` rather than the server, because the
board recomputes them in the browser off tasks it already holds.

This file is the **product rules**: the questions someone reading a date on
the board would ask, answered once. The mechanics, the priors and the reasons
for each design choice are in those modules' own doc comments, which are long
and stay long; nothing here repeats them. Each constant's argument sits beside
the constant — the priors in `effort-calibration.ts`, the pace window in
`effort-task.ts`, the projection horizon in `goal-effort.ts`.

## The modules

```mermaid

  T["A ticket write<br/>create · retitle · body edit · re-triage"] --> SC["effort-scoring.ts<br/>when to ask, and the boot re-ask pass"]
  SC --> ES["effort-estimator.ts<br/>the Haiku call: key, HTTP, timeout"]
  ES --> EP["core/effort-estimate-prompt.ts<br/>prompt and parser, both pure"]
  ES --> TR["task-row.ts<br/>the estimate, stored on the task"]

  EF --> UI["board/board-island.tsx · board/board-detail-render.ts<br/>the goal bar and the detail panel"]
```

The server asks for the estimate and stores it; every number a reader sees is
computed in the browser from tasks it already holds. That is why the four
`effort-*` files are in `core` and not in the server.

## The chain

```mermaid

  E["Per-ticket estimate<br/>(Haiku, chunk 2)"] --> C["Calibration<br/>actual ÷ estimate"]
  C --> R["Corrected remainder"]
  P["Closes in the goal's<br/>active window"] --> PA["Pace<br/>estimate-seconds per day"]
  R --> D["Remainder ÷ pace<br/>= projected finish"]
  PA --> D
```

Estimates are on both sides of every fraction. A measured number is never
multiplied — a correction scales the forecast and nothing else.

## Pace is measured over the span the goal actually moved in

The denominator is **the stretch the goal's counted closes happened in** —
the earliest one to now — clamped to `[EFFORT_MIN_PACE_WINDOW_DAYS,
EFFORT_PACE_WINDOW_DAYS]`: one hour to fourteen days.

It was a flat fourteen days for every goal, which made the divisor a fact
about the calendar rather than about the goal. Replacing that with the goal's
**age** fixed half of it and left the half that prompted the ticket. Measured
on the live board: a goal three and a half days old closed most of itself in
one four-hour run, and dividing that run by the goal's age still read as a
trickle — it moved the finish from a week out to a day and a half out, when
the goal was running at hours.

Age is how long a goal has **existed**. A pace is a fact about the stretch in
which it **moved**. A goal that sat for three days and then ran for four
hours has a four-hour window; the three quiet days are not evidence about its
rate.

- **Counted closes site the window**, using the same predicate the numerator
  uses: an observed close (see the next section) carrying an estimate, inside
  the fourteen-day ceiling. So the window is exactly the span of the closes
  it will be divided into, and no counted close can fall outside a window
  derived from it. A swept close or an unscored one sites nothing — neither
  reaches the numerator, and widening the window to reach one would divide
  the real closes by a span none of them spent.
- **Closes are summed, never serialized.** Two tickets worked in parallel and
  closed in the same hour are two closes in that hour, not one after the
  other. Throughput is what the goal got through, not what one worker could
  have done end to end.
- **The ceiling is fourteen days** because a rate learned from what a goal
  was doing two months ago is history, not a rate.
- **The floor is one hour**, and this is what bounds a very young window.
  Three tickets closed within a minute of each other span almost no time at
  all; dividing their estimates by that span claims a rate no work produced,
  and a goal with an afternoon of work left would project *done in ten
  minutes*. Below an hour a goal is reported at the pace it managed in an
  hour — the most a burst of evidence can honestly say — so the soonest
  finish any goal can be given is an hour out. An hour rather than a day
  because a day is not a floor here but a different answer: rounding that
  four-hour afternoon up to a day puts the finish back out past tomorrow,
  which is the reading this window exists to stop.
- **The window ends at now, not at the last close**, so it decays on its own.
  An afternoon's burst is a four-hour window that afternoon and a
  twenty-eight-hour window a day later. No goal keeps claiming a sprint's
  rate for having sprinted once.
- **Nothing closed yet** → the fallback is the goal's age, taken from the
  oldest live ticket's `createdAt` (or that ticket's earliest transition).
  Nothing is projected from it — a date needs
  `EFFORT_MIN_CLOSES_FOR_PROJECTION` closes — so it only answers "how long
  has this been going". A band with **no timestamp anywhere** gets the full
  fourteen days, not the floor: nothing is known about its age, and an hour
  is a claim about a young goal rather than a neutral answer.

The guards above the window are unchanged: a projection still needs three
observed closes, and one still stops being a date past
`EFFORT_MAX_PROJECTION_DAYS` (a year), where the readout says how far out it
is instead of naming a day.

The header sentence names the window it actually used — "on the last 4 hours'
pace", "on the last 3 days' pace" — so the number on screen and the number in
the arithmetic are the same one. **It counts hours below two days.** Rounding
to whole days misstates the denominator by `0.5 / n`: a third of it at a day
and a half, a fifth at two and a half, and shrinking from there. Naming a
four-hour window "1 day" is not a rounding error in that sentence but a
different claim about how the date was made, and a 35-hour window called "1
day" is the same defect one unit up — so the hour wording reaches past the
first day, and days take over where the error is under a quarter and falling.

## A close with no work behind it is not throughput

A ticket that went **straight to done** — closed without ever entering
`in-progress` — is excluded from **calibration, pace and the projection
floor** alike.

Nobody watched it being worked, so there is no wall-clock actual to learn a
correction from; that half was always excluded. The other two halves were
not, and that was the bug: closing five stale tasks in one afternoon added
five closes and their whole estimate to the numerator of a rate that is
supposed to describe throughput, and the goal's projected finish jumped
forward on an afternoon of bookkeeping. Sweeping a backlog is not a
speed-up.

So the rule is one rule, in one direction: **an unobserved close teaches
nothing.** It still counts everywhere it is a plain fact rather than
evidence — the percentage bar moves, the remainder drops, `complete` can
become true. What it does not do is set a rate or unlock a date.

`EFFORT_MIN_CLOSES_FOR_PROJECTION` therefore counts **observed** closes: a
goal whose only three closes skipped `in-progress` gets no date, and the
header says so.

The one thing this does **not** narrow is hands-on calibration. Attention is
measured directly, off the reading time folded onto the task, and needs no
`in-progress` transition to be real: somebody read the ticket or they did
not. Only the wall-clock trail depends on the transition that a sweep skips.

## A factor is learned from three closes, not one

Below `EFFORT_MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_CALIBRATION` (3) closed tickets, a level
**inherits the level above it** instead of claiming a correction of its own:

| Closed samples | Where the goal's factor comes from |
| --- | --- |
| 3 or more on the goal | The goal's own median, shrunk toward the board |
| Fewer than 3 on the goal | The board's factor, unmodified |
| Fewer than 3 on the whole board | `EFFORT_PRIOR_*` — the starting assumption |

Shrinkage alone did not hold this line. `n/(n+K)` pulls a goal's median
toward the board's, but `shrink(r, r, 1) = r` exactly — and on a board where
one ticket is the only sample, that one ticket **is** the board median, so it
moved every estimate on the board at full strength. A goal's first close
would rewrite its own forecast and everyone else's; the second one could
rewrite it back.

Three is the same floor `EFFORT_MIN_CLOSES_FOR_PROJECTION` and
`EFFORT_MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_RANGE` already use. One number, for the same reason
in all three places: below three, there is a data point, not a distribution.

### Saying so on the board

`EffortRatio.samples` counts the closes the factor was **learned from**, and
stays `0` while a level is inheriting — a prior is not evidence, and no
surface may report one as "×N from M closed tickets".
`EffortRatio.observedSamples` counts what was actually seen, so a panel can
say "two closes so far, below the three needed" instead of the false "nothing
has closed yet".

**Inheritance carries the factor, never the evidence.** A goal that has
closed nothing takes the board's number and both of its counts come back
zero, because every sentence on these surfaces ends "on this goal" — a board
holding forty closes under other bands must not report forty under this one.
`ratioForGoal` does the zeroing at the single point the inheritance happens,
so no caller has to remember to. Such a goal is still explained rather than
left with an unaccounted-for ×0.09: the panel says the factor was learned
from closed tickets *elsewhere on the board*.

Neither of those answers the question a marker on the board has to ask, so
there is a third field. `samples: 0` is true both of a goal inheriting a
board that has learned from forty closes — a measured correction — and of one
inheriting a prior nothing has corrected — a guess. `EffortRatio.calibrated`
separates them: it is true when the factor rests on measured closes
*anywhere*, at this level or the one it came from.

A projection resting on an **un**calibrated factor is marked **"estimate
only"** on the goal strip, under the date it qualifies. It rides the date's
own column and never the title's: the title is the primary task at every
width (Bryan, 2026-08-30), and a caveat that pushes it is a caveat in the
wrong place. Unlike the coverage note it survives the narrow tier — a date
silently presented as measured when nothing measured it is the readout being
wrong, not merely terse.

With a date on screen the marker means one thing in practice: the goal's
closes were scored under an **older prompt**. A date needs three observed
closes, and an observed close scored under the current ask is exactly what
the calibrator counts — so three of those would have calibrated it. This is
the visible cost of changing the question, which the module has always paid
deliberately rather than carrying a stale answer forward.

## What a reader is owed

Every absence is a different sentence, and none of them is a zero.

| On screen | Means |
| --- | --- |
| no bar, "not scored yet" | Nothing under this goal has been scored |
| no bar, "scoring failed on N" | The scorer ran and produced nothing |
| `date after 3 closes` | Too little has closed to set a pace |
| `over a year out` | A pace exists; the remainder divides past the horizon |
| `~Sep 12 · estimate only` | A date, from a factor no close has corrected |
| `done` | Every scored ticket in this goal is closed |
