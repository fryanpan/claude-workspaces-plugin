# Testing standards

What a test in this repo has to do to be worth its runtime. Each standard
names the check that enforces it. `bun run test:audit` is the mechanical half;
it counts proxies for three of these and ratchets the counts down via
`scripts/test-audit.baseline.json`. A count may only fall — lower the baseline
in the same commit that lowers the count.

It reads untracked files as well as tracked ones, so a test you have written
but not staged is judged locally exactly as CI will judge it once committed.
It used to enumerate with `git ls-files` alone, which made the gate blind to
the new tests it exists to check.

## 1. Assert behaviour, not source shape

Drive the thing and assert what it did. A regex over a bundle, a source file
or a stylesheet's text is not a test of behaviour: it passes when the string
survives a rename that breaks the feature, and fails when a refactor moves a
declaration that still works. For layout and styling, render the page and read
the computed value — `bun run ui:shot` gives you a real browser.

*Check:* `test:audit` counts source/bundle/stylesheet reads in test files that
assert with `toContain`, `toMatch`, `toBe`, `toEqual`, `toStrictEqual` or an
ordered comparison. It cannot tell a legitimate read (a generator's output)
from an illegitimate one, so the count is a ceiling, not a verdict.

**The read does not have to be in the test file.** A test that imports a
module from its own test tree which reads source counts too, and the site
listed is the import line. Nine MCP tests read `packages/mcp/src` through
`packages/mcp/test/harness/mcp-source.ts` and were invisible for as long as
that harness existed; two of them had widened their slice to the whole file
tail while the table stayed green. Moving a read one module away is not an
escape.

A reading module is assumed to hand that text to its importers. To be exempt
it needs three things, and the marker is only one of them:

1. a comment line holding nothing but `audit: no-text`. Prose that quotes the
   phrase exempts nothing — the first version matched it anywhere on a line,
   so deleting the real marker from a harness moved no count at all because
   the module's header paragraph said the words.
2. every exported value carrying an explicit type or return annotation. No
   annotation is no evidence: `export const BOARD_TEXT = TEXT['board.css'];` is a
   one-line hole that inference fills with `string` while a regex sees
   nothing.
3. none of those annotations naming `string`.

So the marker is a claim the check verifies rather than believes.
`packages/workspaces-app/test/css-harness.ts` is the module the exemption
exists for: it reads four stylesheets only to install them in the test
document and returns computed styles, so its forty-six importers are
asserting behaviour, not source shape. Reads under a `fixtures/` path are not
counted at all — a parser driven over sample input is behaviour.

The read may be wrapped: the window is the read call's own parentheses,
followed across whatever lines the formatter put them on. It used to be one
line, which meant a rename could lower the count with nothing converted — PR
718's `src/hub/` → `src/board/` pushed a read in `walk-handoff.test.ts` past
biome's width, biome wrapped it, and the site went uncounted while still
grepping source. A neighbouring statement's literal is still not the read's:
the parentheses bound the window, and a probe in `scripts/test-audit.test.ts`
plants a source literal on the line after a read's closing paren to keep that
true.

Three things the check still cannot see, so a clean table is not proof: a read
whose path is in a constant declared elsewhere, a support module outside a
`test/` directory, and `require()`.

## 2. No fixed sleeps in the server suite

A `sleep(1100)` waiting on the ~1s doc write-back is both slow and flaky: it
pays the full second every run and still loses on a loaded machine. Poll for
the observable the test is actually waiting on — a flushed file, a socket
message, a log line, a row appearing. The house pattern is `waitFor` in
`packages/server/test/wait-for.ts`; `waitForBlock` in `server.test.ts` is the
older hand-rolled form of the same loop.

A wait that is itself the assertion — proving nothing happens inside a debounce
window, or that a TTL has not yet expired — is legitimate. Inject the clock
where the module allows it; otherwise keep the sleep and mark it `// timed:`
with the window it is proving, which exempts it from the audit.

*Check:* `test:audit` counts `sleep(N)` and `setTimeout(fn, N)` with N >= 500
in `packages/server/test`, minus the `// timed:` ones.

### The cadences are scaled, so never write one as a literal

Polling cannot shorten a debounce the server itself schedules, and the suite
crosses that chain hundreds of times. So `CW_TEST_TIMING_SCALE` multiplies
every doc cadence in `packages/server/src/doc-store-timings.ts` by one factor.
`packages/server/test/timing.preload.ts` sets it to `0.1` for every `bun test`
run, which is why the documented gate needs no extra flag.

One factor, not one knob per cadence: the ORDER of these debounces is
load-bearing — the `.ydoc` persists before the `.md` write-back, which is what
makes "a crash inside the flush window" a state a test can build. A uniform
scale preserves every ratio. Unset, malformed, or above 1 gives the
production defaults unchanged, asserted by
`packages/server/test/doc-store-timings.test.ts` in a subprocess with the variable
removed from the environment.

The consequence for tests: a `// timed:` wait must DERIVE its window from
those constants. `packages/server/test/wait-for.ts` exports the four —
`pastWriteBack`, `pastExternalRead`, `insideWriteBack`, `pastReanchor`, plus
`afterPersist` for the gap between the two debounces. A literal `700` meant to
sit inside an 800ms window sits far outside an 80ms one, which silently turns
the race a test builds into no race at all.

*Check:* no check yet. The audit cannot tell a literal that rides a scaled
cadence from one that rides an unscaled timer elsewhere in the server.

## 3. No wall-clock assertions

`expect(Date.now() - t0).toBeLessThan(2000)` fails on a loaded CI runner and
passes on a broken fast path. Assert the order of events, the number of calls,
or the state a scheduler reached — not how long the machine took. Where timing
genuinely is the behaviour under test, inject a clock and advance it.

*Check:* `test:audit` counts `expect()` on a `Date.now()`/`performance.now()`
value or on a variable assigned from a now() delta.

## 4. Every new server module ships with a unit test

A new file under `packages/server/src` lands in the same commit as a test that
exercises it directly, not only through a route that happens to reach it.

*Check:* no check yet. Reviewer's eye on the diff.

## 5. Browser and layout checks run headless

Never drive a human's browser window. `bun run ui:shot` opens headless
Chromium against a throwaway profile. Verify at **1180x820** (tablet/laptop,
where height is the scarce axis) and **430** wide, per
[docs/product/design-mobile.md](../../docs/product/design-mobile.md).

### Two budgets, and neither is vitest's default

A test that launches a real browser pays for a process spawn, a profile
directory and a CDP handshake before any page exists, and then for the page.
Give each its own number.

- **The vitest case timeout.** Vitest's default is 5s; a launch plus a load is
  4–6s unloaded on this machine, so the default loses to a neighbouring suite
  rather than to an assertion. Pass an explicit per-case timeout — the
  Chrome-launching cases here use `60_000`.
- **ui-shot's `--timeout`.** It is the ceiling for load and `--wait-for` only.
  The browser launch has its own `STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS`, because one number
  doing both jobs failed CI twice with `CDP never came up within 15000ms` on
  a branch whose diff touched neither ui-shot nor the page under test —
  a cold start inside a shard running a hundred other files.

**And check the guard actually lets the test run.** A real-browser case behind
`skipIf` reads identically to a passing one in a green log. Resolve the binary
through `resolveChromeBin(undefined)`, which reaches `CHROME_CANDIDATES` and
so finds the runner's own Chrome with no path named; `CW_CHROME_BIN ??
DEFAULT_CHROME_BIN` names the macOS `/Applications` path and skips everywhere
else. Prove it by reading the test COUNT off a CI run, not the colour.

*Check:* no check yet.

## 6. The gates, and what each one catches

`bun run verify` runs all of them. None is a subset of another, and this table
is not the list to work from — `bun run verify --list` is, because it cannot
go stale (`bun run verify:parity` fails the build if it does). The four rows
below are the ones a test author is most likely to be reasoning about.

| Gate | Catches what the others miss |
| --- | --- |
| `test:vitest` | unit + client suites (workspaces-app, core, widget) |
| `test:server` | the server suite; vitest does not run it |
| `typecheck` | type errors; neither runner typechecks |
| `test:audit` | the mechanical half of this file, ratcheted |

The other eleven — lint, coverage, `loc:audit`, the import-direction and
architecture gates, the widget build and its size budget, the build-id and
MCP-bundle checks, the leak-gate self-test, the plugin-version gate — are
members of the same command. This table names four; `verify` runs fifteen.
