# Setup

First-time setup for a fresh clone of `claude-workspaces-plugin`. Walk the user through the steps in order. Pause for confirmation between sections that touch system state; skip optional sections if they say no.

## What this skill does

Brings a fresh checkout of this repo to a working state:

1. Installs JS dependencies (`bun install`)
2. Installs the git hooks that gate leaks at commit and push time
3. Wires the shell alias that enables Claude Channels for `plugin:claude-workspaces@claude-workspaces`
4. Registers this repo's GitHub marketplace and installs the plugin at user scope
5. (Optional) Installs the macOS launchd supervisor so the claude-workspaces server survives logout / Mac reboot / crashes
6. (Optional on macs with home on a non-default volume) Surfaces the Full Disk Access prereq for the launchd-spawned bun

## Steps

### 1. Confirm scope with the user

Ask once:

> "I'll run first-time setup for this repo. Plan: install JS deps, wire the dev-channels shell alias in your `~/.zshrc` (or equivalent), register the plugin marketplace, and install the plugin at user scope. Optionally I can install the macOS launchd supervisor so the server runs in the background and survives reboots. Anything you want to skip up front?"

Wait for their answer. If they say "just do it," proceed; if they want to skip parts (e.g. the launchd supervisor), honor that.

If `node_modules/` already exists, `command claude plugin list` shows `claude-workspaces@claude-workspaces`, and the alias is already in their shell init — recap "Already set up — here's what I'd suggest next" and exit. Don't redo steps unnecessarily.

### 2. Install JS dependencies

```sh
bun install
```

If `bun` isn't on their PATH, point them at <https://bun.sh> — don't install bun for them. Once they have it, retry.

Verify: `node_modules/` exists at the repo root.

### 2b. Install the git hooks — one command, do not skip it

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This is what turns on the leak gate. `.githooks/pre-commit` refuses a commit
that ADDS a private project name or a denylisted string; `.githooks/pre-push`
re-reads the whole of every file the push publishes, as the backstop. This is a
public repo, so a leak that reaches a commit costs a history rewrite and one
that reaches a push is public record.

Until this command is run the clone is **unprotected and indistinguishable from
a protected one** — git reads `.git/hooks`, which is empty, so nothing fails and
nothing prints. `bun install` warns about it (`postinstall` runs
`scripts/check-hooks.sh`); `bun run check:hooks` answers the same question
directly and exits non-zero when the hooks are missing.

Verify:

```sh
bun run check:hooks       # prints "commit + push leak gates are installed"
bun run check:scrub-gate  # proves the gate can still SEE a planted needle
```

The second one matters as much as the first: this scanner's real failure mode
is scanning nothing and exiting 0, which it did undetected for weeks.

### 3. Wire the shell alias for Claude Channels

The plugin uses Claude Code's channel events (push notifications from the server to the agent session). That feature is currently behind the `--dangerously-load-development-channels` flag. Easiest way to keep it active is a shell function in their `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc` if they use bash):

```sh
claude() { /path/to/claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:claude-workspaces@claude-workspaces "$@"; }
```

Important:

- Confirm their shell first (`echo $SHELL`).
- Find their actual `claude` binary path (`which claude`) — substitute it into the alias.
- Show them the line before appending it to their init file. Ask: "Want me to append this to your `~/.zshrc`?" Wait for explicit yes — this modifies a file they own.
- After appending, tell them to run `source ~/.zshrc` (or open a new terminal) and relaunch Claude Code from that new shell.

If they'd rather edit the file themselves, give them the exact line and the file path.

### 4. Register the plugin + install at user scope

```sh
command claude plugin marketplace add fryanpan/claude-workspaces-plugin
command claude plugin install claude-workspaces@claude-workspaces --scope user
```

Explain: the first command registers the GitHub repo as a plugin marketplace; the second installs the claude-workspaces plugin user-wide so it's available in every Claude Code session. Updates come from GitHub: `command claude plugin marketplace update claude-workspaces`, then `command claude plugin update claude-workspaces@claude-workspaces`, then restart the session.

Use `command claude`, not bare `claude`: once step 3's shell function exists, bare `claude` prepends the channels flag, and that breaks the `plugin` subcommands.

If they are changing the plugin itself and want a session to load their working copy, run `command claude plugin marketplace add .` from the clone root INSTEAD of the GitHub line. The marketplace is then this checkout, and a plugin update reads whatever it holds.

There is **no `npm link` step** — the MCP server bundle is vendored into the plugin tree at `packages/plugin/mcp/index.js` and invoked via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` substitution in `.mcp.json`. (See PR #35 for why we moved off the `npm link` install path.)

After install, the plugin's tools should appear when they ask Claude things like:
- "Show me the doc `<your doc name>` in a workspace"
- "Show me a mockup in a workspace"
- "Show me the dev server in a workspace"

### 5. (Optional) Start the server

```sh
bun run dev
```

This is the foreground supervisor — fine for development, dies when the terminal closes. It picks a free port starting at 8787, writes it to `~/.claude/claude-workspaces/server.json` so the plugin can find it, and prints the reachable URLs (`localhost`, plus a Tailscale and a LAN name when it finds them). The board is the `localhost` URL with a trailing `/`. By default only a browser on this machine gets in: the Tailscale and LAN names answer 403 until the server starts with `CW_ACCESS_ONLY_BROWSER_HOSTS=0`, which admits anything on that network (see `docs/architecture/security.md`). Ask before turning it off. Data goes in `data/` inside the clone unless `CW_DATA_DIR` is set.

Tell them to keep this terminal open while they work; close it when done. For an always-on setup, point them at the next step.

### 6. (Optional) Install the macOS launchd supervisor

If they want the server to stay up across logout / Mac reboot / crashes, install the per-user LaunchAgent:

```sh
./scripts/launchd/install.sh
```

Before running it, **check the repo path**:

```sh
pwd -P
```

**Heads-up for macs with home on a non-default volume.** If the resolved path starts with `/Volumes/<X>/...`, the launchd-spawned bun needs **Full Disk Access** to read the repo — otherwise it wedges in `getcwd()` with EPERM, logs stay empty, and the install script times out. Grant it FIRST:

1. System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access
2. Click "+", then ⌘⇧G to type the path `command -v bun` prints (usually `~/.bun/bin/bun`)
3. Toggle it on
4. Then re-run `./scripts/launchd/install.sh`

If `pwd -P` shows a `/Users/...` path directly (standard macOS install), the FDA step is not required — skip it.

`install.sh` does its own detection and will print the same instructions if it sees the symptom pattern (empty logs + repo under `/Volumes/`). Either way, the recovery is the same.

The service label defaults to the one in the plist template. `CW_LAUNCHD_LABEL=<reverse-dns-name>` on `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh` installs it under another; the server's self-deploy restart and its Keychain key lookup still expect the default, so only change it when two services must coexist.

Verify after (`install.sh` prints the label it used):

```sh
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/<label>" | grep "state ="
curl -sS http://localhost:8787/ -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
```

Should print `state = running` and `200`.

### 6b. (Optional) Serve over HTTPS on the tailnet — required for voice

Skip this unless the machine is on a Tailscale tailnet **and** anyone wants the
board's voice dock or review-doc dictation from a device other than the host.

`http://<tailnet-name>:8787` is **not a secure context**, so Chrome does not
expose the microphone there at all — `navigator.mediaDevices` is `undefined`.
The failure is worse than a plain refusal: the `SpeechRecognition` constructor
still exists, so `start()` answers `not-allowed` with no permission prompt, and
telling someone to "allow the mic for this site" sends them looking for a
control the browser never offered. Loopback is exempt (browsers trust it
whatever the scheme), which is why it works on the host and nowhere else.

Two steps, and **the second is not optional polish** — doing only the first
looks like success and changes nothing for voice:

```sh
# 1. Terminate TLS on the tailnet name, proxying to the running server.
#    Note the flag form: the port must arrive as --https=, because `serve`
#    reads a bare positional as the target.
tailscale serve --https=443 --bg http://127.0.0.1:8787
tailscale serve status        # must say "(tailnet only)"

# 2. Point every link the server emits at that origin, then restart it.
CW_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://<tailnet-name> ./scripts/launchd/install.sh
```

`publicBaseUrl` is the single source of every `reviewUrl`, `entryUrl` and
task-import `hubUrl` the server hands a human. Without step 2 those keep
reading `http://<tailnet-name>:8787`, so every link an agent pastes lands back
on the insecure origin and voice stays dead for whoever follows it. The value
is validated at boot — a malformed one is a named startup failure, never a
silent fallback.

**`serve` is tailnet-only. `tailscale funnel` is the verb that would make this
public — do not use it.** And `install.sh` regenerates the plist from a
template on every run, so a hand-edited `CW_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is silently
discarded the next time anyone reinstalls; set it through the installer.

Full rationale, the measured before/after table, the non-vacuous verification
(each check needs its "before" reading or it proves nothing), and rollback:
[docs/process/tailnet-https.md](../../../docs/process/tailnet-https.md).

### 7. Confirm done + suggest next step

Recap in one line: "Setup complete. Plugin installed at user scope; server <foreground / launchd-supervised>."

Then suggest the natural next move:
- "Bind a markdown file you want to review: ask me `please bring docs/foo.md into a workspace` — I'll create the review doc and give you a URL."
- "Or try the demo mockup at `http://localhost:<port>/demos/mockup` to see the comment widget in action."

## What to avoid

- **Don't append to `~/.zshrc` without explicit confirmation.** Shell init files are user-owned; modifying them requires per-turn user yes.
- **Don't run `./scripts/launchd/install.sh` without confirmation.** It writes to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` and starts a service that persists across sessions.
- **Don't grant Full Disk Access on the user's behalf** — that requires the System Settings GUI + an auth prompt. Always direct the user to do it themselves.
- **Don't install bun for them** — let them install via the official installer (<https://bun.sh>).
- **Don't repeat this skill on subsequent runs.** If `node_modules/` exists and the alias is already wired and the plugin is installed, tell the user "Already set up — what would you like to do?" and exit.
