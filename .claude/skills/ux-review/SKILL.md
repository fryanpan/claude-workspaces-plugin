# UX Review

The biggest source of rework on UI work is shipping something that the agent has only ever read in code form. The user opens it in production, can't figure out where to click, tries the wrong thing, and sends it back. This skill makes the agent USE the page as a fresh user and catch the friction before the user does.

## When to invoke

- After implementing a UI change, before calling it done
- Before opening a PR for any UI feature
- Before merging on UI-impacting `/ship-it` runs
- Anytime an agent says "the UI is ready" — invoke this first

## What you'll need

- The UI running locally (a dev server URL) OR a deployed URL
- The user goal(s) the page is supposed to enable
- A browser that is **not the owner's window** — `bun run ui:shot` (`scripts/ui-shot.ts`), which launches Chrome's own binary headless with a throwaway profile and drives it over CDP at an exact viewport

### The browser rule: not the owner's window — never "no browser"

The rule is stated exactly this way because both halves have been broken. Three
agents in one day opened tabs in the owner's live Chrome under briefs that only
forbade *closing* tabs; two others over-corrected into no browser at all and
reviewed from the code. `claude-in-chrome` tools open tabs in the owner's running
Chrome — do not use them for this review, and do not ask them to start Chrome
with the extension. Do not "review from the code" either — that defeats the
purpose. The script satisfies both halves: it is a real Chrome, and it is a
separate instance nobody is looking at.

```bash
bun run ui:shot --url <url> --preset ipad  --out shots/initial-1180.png
bun run ui:shot --url <url> --preset phone --out shots/initial-430.png \
  --eval 'document.documentElement.scrollWidth > window.innerWidth'
bun run ui:shot --url <url> --wait-for '.thread' --eval-file probe.js --out shots/midflow.png
```

It prints one JSON object (viewport, the page's own `innerWidth` /
`devicePixelRatio`, the `result` of `--eval`, the screenshot path). `--eval`
runs **before** the screenshot and promises are awaited, so an async
expression that clicks, waits, and returns a reading gives you a mid-flow
screenshot. `--size WxH` reaches any viewport; `--help` lists every flag; the
verification contract per tier is in `docs/product/design-mobile.md`.

## The walkthrough

Walk each user goal as if you've never seen the page before. For each goal:

1. **Land on the page cold.** First impression — what does this page tell you it does, without reading carefully? If a first-time user couldn't answer "what is this?" in 3 seconds, that's a finding.

2. **Find your starting point.** Where does your eye go first? Is the primary action visually dominant? If the most prominent element isn't what the user should click first, that's a finding.

3. **Try to complete the goal.** Click, type, navigate. Note every moment of:
   - "Where do I go now?" (next-step ambiguity)
   - "Is that clickable?" (affordance failure)
   - "What does this button do?" (label clarity)
   - "Did that work?" (feedback failure)
   - "I made a mistake — how do I undo?" (recovery failure)

4. **Try to mess it up.** Submit empty fields. Click the wrong thing first. Use keyboard only. What breaks?

5. **Try to do it on mobile.** Chrome will not make a window narrower than ~500px, so resizing a browser cannot reach a phone viewport at all — run `bun run ui:shot --preset phone` (430×932 with touch emulation, the width this repo verifies at per `docs/product/design-mobile.md`). A `page.innerWidth` above 430 in its output means the page overflowed and the phone zoomed out to fit it. Targets too small? Layout broken? Important content below the fold?

Take screenshots at the key states — initial load, mid-flow, completion, error states — at 1180×820 AND 430px; they fail differently and neither substitutes for the other.

The three subsections below describe measurement traps in a **windowed** browser. The headless script sidesteps them — a headless page is never backgrounded, and it is launched with timer throttling disabled — but a `--eval` probe still needs the page to have reached the state it measures (`--wait-for`, and `--settle` for anything deferred a frame), and truncation is a property of whatever you read, not of the tool.

### Reading the page: absence needs a query, not a snapshot

`read_page` truncates at 50,000 characters by default, and it truncates at the
**bottom** — where the region you came to review usually is. A cut snapshot and
a page that never rendered look identical.

- **Pass an explicit high `max_chars`** (or a `ref_id` scoped to the region you
  care about) when reading a long surface. The claude-workspaces workspace board is
  one: its accessibility tree already runs ~24k characters and grows with every
  task added, so the default is a ceiling you will hit without noticing.
- **Treat the truncation footer as load-bearing, not boilerplate.** It is the
  only thing in the response that distinguishes "this element isn't on the page"
  from "I stopped reading before it".
- **Before reporting any element missing, run a query that can see it** —
  `document.querySelector` / `querySelectorAll().length` via `javascript_tool`,
  or a re-read scoped with `ref_id`. A finding of the form "X is absent from the
  DOM" is only worth filing once a query that *could* have found X came back
  empty.

An orchestrating session skipped this and filed a production regression against
four merged PRs — retracting a completed task and holding a deploy — over two
DOM regions that were merely past the cut. See "A truncated page read is
indistinguishable from a page that never rendered" in
`docs/process/learnings.md`.

### Before concluding a behaviour did not happen, prove the page could have done it

A probe that reports "the feature did not fire" is an absence, and an absence
is only worth reporting once you have shown the page was in a state where the
feature *could* have fired.

- **A backgrounded Chrome window never fires `requestAnimationFrame`.** When
  `document.visibilityState === 'hidden'`, rAF callbacks are not throttled —
  they are not called at all, indefinitely. Anything scheduled through one has
  simply not run: a measure-then-clamp that sets a max-height, a
  scroll-into-view on mount, a layout decision deferred one frame to let fonts
  settle. The DOM you read back is the pre-decision DOM, and it reads exactly
  like a broken feature.
- Measured here on two features in one pass — a summary that clamps itself to
  `44vh` reported its ceiling equal to its natural height (i.e. "clipping never
  engages"), and a page that scrolls to its ask on mount reported `scrollY: 0`.
  Both were working. The window was behind the terminal.
- **Check it directly rather than assuming the window is in front**, since a
  screenshot, a click, or a `navigate` will foreground it and change the answer
  under you:

  ```js
  document.visibilityState                       // 'hidden' invalidates any rAF-dependent reading
  await new Promise((res) => {                   // the positive control: does a frame arrive at all?
    requestAnimationFrame(() => res(true));
    setTimeout(() => res(false), 800);
  });
  ```

  If that promise resolves `false`, no frame arrived — take a screenshot
  first (that foregrounds the window), then re-measure. Do not report the
  first reading.
- The general form, and it outlives rAF: **satisfy every precondition the
  behaviour has before measuring its absence** — a frame for rAF work, a
  dismissed modal for anything the page awaits, a scrolled viewport for
  virtualized DOM, a completed handshake for a socket. Same family as "a
  negative test needs a positive control": the probe ran, it just measured a
  page that never got to the point of deciding.

### Timing the page: a backgrounded tab's clock is not yours

- **Chrome clamps timers in a tab that isn't in front** — measured here at 3
  ticks in 2 seconds where 50 were expected. Anything you time in a hidden tab
  (a debounce, a retry backoff, an animation) reads LONGER than it is, so the
  measurement supports a lower bound and never an exact value. Don't report
  "the delay is 3s" from a background tab.
- **What throttling does not undermine is whether the delay exists at all.**
  Events are not throttled — a WebSocket close, a click, an inbound message
  arrives immediately — so an implementation with no debounce paints within
  milliseconds regardless of which tab is in front. "There is a delay here" is
  provable in the background; its duration isn't.

## The heuristic checklist

After the walkthrough, evaluate against these. For each, mark Pass / Issue / Critical:

**Visibility & feedback (Nielsen #1)**
- Does the system tell the user what's happening at all times?
- After every action, is there visible confirmation within ~1 second?

**Match between system and real world (Nielsen #2)**
- Are labels in the user's language, not technical jargon?
- Do icons match what the user would expect them to mean?

**User control and freedom (Nielsen #3)**
- Is there an obvious way to undo a mistake?
- Can the user back out of any flow without losing progress?

**Consistency and standards (Nielsen #4)**
- Do similar things look similar? Different things look different?
- Does the page follow conventions the user already knows from other sites?

**Error prevention (Nielsen #5)**
- Are dangerous actions confirmed before they happen?
- Are inputs validated as the user types, not after submit?

**Recognition over recall (Nielsen #6)**
- Are options visible, or does the user have to remember what's available?
- Is necessary information available where it's needed?

**Flexibility and efficiency (Nielsen #7)**
- Are there shortcuts for power users (keyboard, bulk actions)?
- Can the user customize what they see frequently?

**Aesthetic and minimalist design (Nielsen #8)**
- Is every element on the page necessary for the user's goal?
- Does decoration compete with the primary action for attention?

**Recover from errors (Nielsen #9)**
- When something goes wrong, does the message say what happened, why, and what to do next?
- Are error messages constructive, not blaming?

**Help and documentation (Nielsen #10)**
- If help is needed, is it findable in context?
- Can the user accomplish the goal without leaving the page to read docs?

**Motor / Fitts's Law**
- Are click targets at least the floor **this project** sets? Read the number out of
  `docs/product/design-mobile.md` rather than from memory — it is **36×36px** there today,
  and a generic 44×44px heuristic that used to sit on this line filed a false merge blocker
  against a shipped PR, because every reviewer loads this checklist and none of them opened
  the doc. Anything between the project floor and some remembered larger number is **not a
  finding**. Below the floor is. (Desktop: ≥24×24px.)
- Is the most-used target closest to where the user's hand/cursor naturally rests?
- Are destructive actions far from frequent ones?

**Visual hierarchy**
- Does the visually dominant element on the page match the user's most likely first action?
- Does the eye naturally flow in the order the user needs to read/act?
- Is there enough contrast between primary and secondary actions?

**Goal completion**
- Did you actually accomplish the goal?
- How many steps did it take vs. how many it should have?
- At any point did you guess what to do, or did the page tell you?

## How to use the report

- **Critical issues:** do not ship. Fix and re-run the review.
- **Issues:** fix before opening PR, or open PR with explicit acknowledgement and follow-up tickets.
- **Polish:** open as follow-ups, ship the main feature.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't review from the code.** The whole point is to see what the user sees. If you can't run it, say so and stop.
- **Don't review in the owner's browser.** "Not their window" is the rule, and "no browser" is the other way to break it. The headless script is the browser.
- **Don't grade your own homework.** If the agent that built the feature is doing the review, dispatch a fresh subagent without context to walk it cold. Familiarity hides friction.
- **Don't over-engineer the heuristics.** The point is to catch obvious problems quickly, not write a 10-page evaluation.
- **Don't skip the goal-completion test.** Heuristic violations can be wrong; failure to complete a goal can't.
- **Don't report an element missing because a snapshot didn't contain it.** Query for it first — a truncated read is the likelier explanation, and "the feature is gone" is the most expensive thing you can say wrongly.

## Future enhancements (not yet implemented)

- Wire `npx -y a11y-mcp-server` for automated WCAG/keyboard scans
- Wire Lighthouse for performance + accessibility scoring
- For high-stakes UI changes, dispatch multiple persona-driven walkthroughs (UXAgent-style — see `research/2026-04-17-ux-evaluation-tooling.md`)
